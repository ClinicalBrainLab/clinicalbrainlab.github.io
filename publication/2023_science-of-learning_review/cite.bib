abstract = {Background
Interest in research on the Science of Learning continues to grow. However, ambiguity about what this field is can negatively impact communication and collaboration and may inadequately inform educational training programs or funding initiatives that are not sufficiently inclusive in focus.
Methods
The present scoping review aimed to synthesize a working definition of the Science of Learning using Web of Science and ProQuest database searches.
Results
In total, 43 unique definitions were identified across 50 documents including journal articles, theses, conference papers, and book chapters. Definitions of the Science of Learning differed considerably when describing the fields thought to contribute to research on this topic.
Conclusions
Based on findings, we propose a working definition of the Science of Learning for discussion and further refinement: the scientific study of the underlying bases of learning with the goal of describing, understanding, or improving learning across developmental stages and diverse contexts.}
