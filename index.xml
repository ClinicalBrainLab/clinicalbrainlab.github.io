      <title>Psychological Determinants of the Susceptibility to Fake News amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2020_deception-covid-fakenews/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2020_deception-covid-fakenews/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the COVID-19 outbreak spreads across the globe, the world is in parallel flooded by information reporting a wide range of facts, which veracity is not always verifiable.
Indeed, it has become increasingly apparent that the COVID-19 fake news pandemic is becoming just as viral as the outbreak of the disease itself, evidenced by the need for researchers
and authorities to track the spread of misinformation. As a consequence, the Ministry of Health in Singapore has even dedicated an entire website (See here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/clarifications&#34;&gt;https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/clarifications&lt;/a&gt;) to debunk all instances of fake news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-role-of-conspiracy-theories&#34;&gt;The Role of Conspiracy Theories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the authorities are struggling to provide concrete explanations about the coronavirus, conspiracy theorists are quick to provide competing ones with confidence.
This has exaggerated the spread of fake news and conspiracy theories - beliefs that seek to explain the cause of an event by a hidden, wicked and unlawful scheme, without scientific support.
For instance, a theory that the new 5G technology causes the spread of coronavirus outbreak was widely circulated and peddled by conspiracy theorists.
Studies have shown that conspiracy theories are often endorsed by people who feel powerless. Their rejection of mainstream accounts and adoption of conspiracy explanations is an attempt to make sense of the world beyond their control (Swami &amp;amp; Furnham, 2010).
The uncertainties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic might prompt people, especially individuals with higher schizotypal tendencies (characterized by suspicion, social anxiety and paranoid ideation), to engage in this sense-making mechanism, seeking alternative explanations
to regain their sense of control. People who have the tendency to adopt conspiracy theories have been found to rely more on intuition (Pennycook, Cheyne, Barr, Koehler &amp;amp; Fugelsang, 2015; Pennycook &amp;amp; Rand, 2018) and are hence more susceptible to fake news beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-role-of-emotions&#34;&gt;The Role of Emotions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a global pandemic where the world is in a constant elevated state of anxiety, fake news beliefs can befall anyone for reasons beyond just the persistent cognitive biases that characterize conspiracist theorists.
People are often left feeling fearful and anxious due to the endless bombardment of pandemic news information, regardless of its accuracy.
Fake news on COVID-19 are especially emotionally engaging because they play on people’s helplessness by offering some miracle remedy or fueling anger towards authorities handling the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Gordon Pennycook, a researcher on the psychology of misinformation, found that individuals are more likely to perceive fake news headlines as accurate when they were in an emotional state (Martel et al., 2019). At the Clinical Brain Lab, we have started research into this area during the
Circuit Breaker period. We propose that the underlying factor driving susceptibility to fake news beliefs is not just the mere presence of negative affect, but how one regulates these emotions.
This refers to the ability to control one’s emotional state, such as considering alternative interpretations of an otherwise negative situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, an important aspect of emotion regulation is being able to navigate through the uncertainties of the future. With future plans now at a standstill and emotions running high, we become less tolerant of uncertainty and feel more helpless about our circumstances.
Poor self-control makes us cognitively lazy, believing something because “it feels right” and aligned with our emotions. Fast, intuitive processing thus often takes precedence over effortful and reflective thinking, of which the latter is needed to discern whether a piece of news is real or fake (Pennycook &amp;amp; Rand, 2019).
We are thus more vulnerable to engaging in fake news than we think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-research&#34;&gt;Our Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is important to delineate the psychological determinants of the belief in fake news as part of a global effort in combating misinformation, Prof Annabel Chen together with Research Fellow Dr Dominique Makowski and research assistants (Pham Thanh Tam and Lau Zen Juen) are currently conducting an investigation into the spread of COVID-19 fake news in Singapore.
Specifically, this study seeks to examine whether the belief in conspiracy theories and one’s ability to regulate emotions are related to one’s tendency to fall prey to fake news.
This study is pre-registered at 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/7d3xh/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OSF&lt;/a&gt; and currently undergoing data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Active Aging Lifestyle</title>
      <link>https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/project/ageing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Combining both cognitive and exercise training in an intervention program may be advantageous to enhance cognitive and physical functions.
However, this approach has yet to be well researched and implemented. Given the hot and humid climate and community environments (e.g., sidewalks and street traffic) in Singapore, common aerobic exercises such as walking and jogging may not be the first choice for sedentary older adults in Singapore.
Therefore, we proposed to develop an intervention program (&lt;strong&gt;ExCITE: Exercise-Cognition Integrated Training for Enhancement&lt;/strong&gt;) that incorporates both cognitive and physical exercise components that can be easily implemented and weaved into the lifestyles of our aging population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Behevioural and Neural Correlates of Deception</title>
      <link>https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/project/deception/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/project/deception/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional lie detection as used in polygraph test is based on examining one&amp;rsquo;s physiological arousal (measuring skin conductance,
heart rate, and respiration) to infer lying. However, such physiological arousal may merely be reflecting anxiety and fear during a polygraph examination,
rather than lying per se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As physiological arousal could not be used to accurately infer lying, researchers are urged to further look into the mental processes related to lying.
To date, different neurophysiological signals, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERP) have been studied for possible application to index deception.
Past studies have shown evidences that strongly supporting the hypothesis that deception requires the coordination of multiple cognitive processes and thus is more cognitively taxing than truth telling.
Despite the positive findings, previous studies were often criticized for not capturing lying as it exists in the real world. Indeed, majority of the experimental paradigms required participants to lie about perceptual
stimuli or memorized materials. More importantly, unlike lying in the real world, the lies generated in research labs were often not spontaneous but instructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To increase the translational value of the research in deception and lie detection, we aim to investigate the neural correlates of lying using paradigms that can elicit lying similar to those in the real world.
In addition, we also seek to explore the structure of dispositional deception by developing and validating a short and reliable questionnaire to characterize individuals&#39; lying patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/project/biliteracy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We use a combination of behavioural assessment, neuroimaging techniques, and intervention to investigate the neural reading networks for bilingual readers from a variety of language profiles, across early childhood and adulthood. Our projects aim to identify the critical factors that influence the neurocognitive mechanisms of non-impaired and impaired reading. Our findings will provide implications for neuroscience-informed remediation of reading difficulties to promote effective bilingual and biliteracy development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ongoing projects:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our projects seek to make cognitive neuroscience findings accessible to educators and facilitate collaborative work between educators and researchers.
The broad goals of our research are to encourage and strengthen dialogue between researchers, practitioners and the wider community to consolidate existing knowledge and generate new hypotheses to answer real-world questions in education and learning.
To achieve these goals we utilise a range of approaches, including language translations, open database platforms, meta-analyses and meta-analytic brain connectivity modelling, data-visualisation and focus group discussions.
This work has important implications in developing educator’s brain literacy and informing teaching and learning to support the growing population of diverse child and adult learners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ongoing Project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding functional relationships between socio-affective and neurocognitive brain networks in adults with ASD and ADHD to better inform learning for learners and educators: Towards maximising the adult learning potential&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/neuropsychology/ComplexSpan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Complex Span&lt;/a&gt; is a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.psychopy.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PsychoPy&lt;/a&gt; implementation of a working memory span task, adapted from 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-015-0566-3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gonthier et al. (2015)&lt;/a&gt;.
Working memory is a critical component of human cognition and can be defined as the ability to store and process information simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task comprises of 2 components, the simple span and the complex span.
The simple span portion presents to-be-remembered consonants, where participants are prompted to type in the correct verbatim recall as each set size increases.
The complex span portion interleaves processing and recall tasks, where open-ended arithmetic operations are presented before to-be-recalled consonants are presented as each set size increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;application&#34;&gt;Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex Span is currently used in our lab to supplement the analysis of behavioural and neurocognitive correlates in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://new.clinicalbrain.org/project/deception/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Deception Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-eeg&#34;&gt;What is EEG?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EEG (Electroencephalogram) is a neuroimaging technique used to measure electrical activity at the scalp that reflects the neural activity in the brain. It is a real-time recording of neural activity with millisecond temporal resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./EEG_Recording.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-an-eeg-done&#34;&gt;How is an EEG Done?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EEG is a completely safe and non-invasive technique. There is no exposure to any form of external x-rays or radiation. To record the EEG signals, an EEG cap would be put over the head and connected to an amplifier which would allow us to see the brain waves on a computer screen.
Electrolytic gel is inserted into the small plastic holders in the cap to improve the conductance between the electrodes and the scalp.
Separate electrodes may also be directly attached to the skin (such as above and below the eyes) using electrode tape.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-fmri&#34;&gt;What is fMRI?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fMRI is a safe, noninvasive imaging technology. Unlike x-rays, which use ionizing radiation, fMRI images are generated from a strong magnetic field and low-power radio-waves.
Therefore, there is no risk of exposure to radiation in fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-use-fmri&#34;&gt;Why use fMRI?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fMRI allows researchers to obtain images of brain activity over time, as participants complete various tasks.
From these images, researchers get a better understanding of the brain areas that are involved in the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-fnirs&#34;&gt;What is fNIRS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fNIRS (functional near-infrared spectroscopy) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain responses by recording changes in the amount of oxygenated/deoxygenated blood.
It works based on the principle of light scattering – the device sends high intensity beams of near-infrared light at the scalp and detects changes to amount of light absorbed within the brain.
Mathematical algorithms are then applied to process the collected data to calculate changes in oxygenated/deoxygenated haemoglobin concentration. These changes are associated with changes in brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./fNIRS2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-fnirs-done&#34;&gt;How is fNIRS Done?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fNIRS is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that does not require any exposure to radiation or x-rays. To record signals, a fNIRS cap is fitted over the participant’s head.
The optodes (sources and detectors) are then attached onto the cap. To ensure the optodes sit directly on the scalp, the participant’s hair may be moved to the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./fNIRS3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-fnirs-used-for&#34;&gt;What is fNIRS used for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently in our lab, we are using fNIRS to explore changes in brain activity during brain stimulation and during cognitive tasks – i.e. reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ClinicalBrainLab/SATA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SATA&lt;/a&gt; is a Matlab Based toolbox that works well with Matlab version 2017 and above.
However, we have not tested SATA for other MATLAB versions. SATA works on Windows, Linux and Mac. SATA is a post-processing toolbox after the tDCS montages have been simulated in COMETS or ROAST. ** To download the Graphical user interface (GUI) version of SATA, please visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.21979/N9/DMWPZK&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.21979/N9/DMWPZK&lt;/a&gt; The SATA GUI package will allow the users to simulate the chosen montages in either COMETS or ROAST, and obtain the post-processed simulation outputs from SATA. Further, you may wish to not use the SATA GUI. In this case, you can download the codes from Github.
However, you will need to download SPM, Fieldtrip, and Talairach client (do add them to matlab path). Similarly, you will have to run COMETS or ROAST separately to generate simulation outputs.So please do download them from their respective websites and see how to use them from their manuals. For details on using the code of SATA, please refer the SATA MANUAL (section 3.4).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation</title>
      <link>https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/resources/techniques/tdcs/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/resources/techniques/tdcs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-tdcs&#34;&gt;What is tDCS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tDCS (Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation) is a non-invasive and relatively painless brain stimulation technique that adjusts regional brain activity through modulating the transmembrane potential of neurons by sending low amplitude direct-current into the scalp.
In healthy populations, anodal tDCS has been shown to increase cortical excitability while cathodal tDCS has been shown to inhibit cortical excitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./tDCS.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-tdcs-done&#34;&gt;How is tDCS Done?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrode to be used is inserted into saline soaked sponges. The region where the electrode is to be placed is first wiped clean with alcohol wipes. Hair is then parted and the sponge is positioned over the marked position and secured in place using rubber straps.
When ready, the experimenter uses the DC-stimulator to start the stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-tdcs-used-for&#34;&gt;What is tDCS used for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently in our lab, we are investigating effects of tDCS on cognitive tasks (e.g. reading) and exploring changes in brain activity as a result of tDCS using fNIRS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</title>
      <link>https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/resources/techniques/tms/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/resources/techniques/tms/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-tms&#34;&gt;What is TMS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) is a non-invasive and painless tool that modulates neural activity. It works on the principle of Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction.
In TMS, an electromagnetic coil sends a perpendicular magnetic field into the region of interest on the scalp. This field indirectly influences neuronal activity. TMS has been shown in some cases to induce cortical excitability and in some cases to depress excitability.
TMS can be administered in bursts at a rhythmic frequency (repetitive TMS) or as a single pulse. Repetitive TMS has been shown to have a greater and lasting effect. Depending on the question, rapid or slow repetitive TMS can be administered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-tms-done&#34;&gt;How is TMS Done?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An electromyography (EMG) module is first attached via a wristband and by pasting electrodes onto the participant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./TMS1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting up the parameters, an experimenter positions the magnetic coil above the participant’s scalp, over the region of interest. When activated, a high-current pulse is produced in the TMS coil, inducing a perpendicular magnetic field.
As high-current pulses are sent through the coil, the participant may hear clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./TMS2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-tms-used-for&#34;&gt;What is TMS used for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMS can be used to treat clinical conditions (such as drug-resistant depression) or be used as an experimental technique to understand brain functions. In our lab, we are applying fMRI-guided TMS to target regions of the brain to determine its involvement in various cognitive networks.
We are also combining it with EEG to understand neuroplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
