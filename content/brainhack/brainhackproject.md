This is wrap-ups from [Brainhack school offical website](https://school-brainhack.github.io/project_guide/)

## Goals
We expect each participants have different data analysis experience and distinct interests. Some participants without experience on brain data would like to learn baisc brain data analysis, but others might seek for advanced analystic techinique that will be beneficial to their research. No matter what the experience you have, your project should contain the new skills you have never learned. You should intensively implement your project in the 4-weeks Brainhack school and acquire these new skills. TAs will help you to build up the project that fit your needs. In the end of course, you should have **two major outcomes** for a project:
1. Submit your project codes, website report, and slides on a Github repository. (The website report can be easily achieved by [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)).
2. Video recorded presentation

Looking for example of project? You can find that from the past Brainhack School [here](https://school-brainhack.github.io/project/).

## Project Progress

### Pre-school preparation
- You will need to fill a form about your experience on brain data analysis, and keyword your are interesting. This information will help us to arrange TAs that will fit to your interests.

### Week 1:

- 0% of time on project. 100% on learning modules.
- If you already completed all the modules before the Brainhack school, you should move to next progress.

### Week 2: 

- You will spend 50% of time on thinking about your project.
- Based on the keyword you're interesting, we will assign 1 or 2 TAs and create **pods** for your project.
- 1 hr project clinic sessions per day (or 5 hrs/a week): TAs will discuss with you to build fundamental ideas for project.
- At end of the week, you have to present your project proposal to your peers and instructors.

### Week 3:

- You will spend 75% of time on implementing project.
- 1 hr project clinic sessions per day (or 5 hrs/a week)

### Week 4:

- You will spend 100% of time to wrap-up your project.
- Submit your project on a Github repository.
- Record a video to present your project.
- Review and comment others project presentation.

## Project Evaluation

- Use of open-science best practices
- Skills and technologies learnt
- Project is relevant to brain data analysis
- Clarity of code and presentation
- Bonus: highly reproducible project, technological achievement, exciting presentation, nice brain picture.
