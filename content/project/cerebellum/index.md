Cerebellum has increasingly been recognized for its contributions beyond motor control to higher cognitive functions. Our work focuses on the roles of cerebellum in working memory, i.e., the ability to hold information in short-term memory. We use neuroimaging techniques to examine the structural and functional connectivity of the cerebro-cerebellar pathways for verbal and visual working memory.
