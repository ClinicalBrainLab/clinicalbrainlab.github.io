<h3>Post-doctoral Research Fellowships/Research Fellow</h3>
<p><strong>We are currently seeking highly motivated individuals who share our passion in deciphering the enigma of the brain to join us at the Clinical Brain Lab , Nanyang Technological University! We are seeking candidates interested in educational neuroscience.</strong></p>
<div id="aim" class="section level5">
<h5><strong>Aim</strong></h5>
<p>We are interested in building capacity for research in the Science of Learning, in particular in the area of educational neuroscience. We seek to understand how cognitive neuroscience can be applied to education to optimize learning. The successful candidate will work closely with researchers at the Centre for Research and Development in Learning (CRADLE), National Institute of Education (NIE), and other international collaborators from institutes such as Johns Hopkins University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and/or University of Cambridge. The current project will be investigating reading brain networks in bilingual children. Singapore is a multicultural city that has a conducive education system to study this.</p>
