On top of revealing complex neuronal processes of the brain that may not be possible with linear approaches, EEG complexity measures have also demonstrated their potential as biomarkers of psychopathology such as depression and schizophrenia. Unfortunately, the opacity of algorithms and descriptions originating from mathematical concepts have made it difficult to understand what complexity is and how to draw consistent conclusions when applied within psychology and neuropsychiatry research. In this review, we provide an overview and entry-level explanation of existing EEG complexity measures, which can be broadly categorized as measures of predictability and regularity. We then synthesize complexity findings across different areas of psychological science, namely, in consciousness research, mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as changes across the lifespan, while addressing some theoretical and methodological issues underlying the discrepancies in the data. Finally, we present important considerations when choosing and interpreting these metrics.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Brain entropy, fractal dimensions and predictability: A review of complexity measures for EEG in healthy and neuropsychiatric populations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2022.\n","date":1658966400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658966400,"objectID":"5d387b27e87b13ecd37c770eaa7c1e31","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/talk/2022_brainconnects/","publishdate":"2022-07-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2022_brainconnects/","section":"talk","summary":"Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2022.","tags":["BrainConnects"],"title":"BrainConnects 2022","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","An Shu Te","Tam Pham","Zen J.

Unfortunately, few studies compare the relationship and objective performance of the plethora of existing metrics, in turn hindering reproducibility, replicability, consistency, and clarity in the field. Using the NeuroKit2 Python software, we computed a list of 112 (predominantly used) complexity indices on signals varying in their characteristics (noise, length and frequency spectrum). We then systematically compared the indices by their computational weight, their representativeness of a multidimensional space of latent dimensions, and empirical proximity with other indices. Based on these considerations, we propose that a selection of 12 indices, together representing 85.97% of the total variance of all indices, might offer a parsimonious and complimentary choice in regards to the quantification of the complexity of time series. Our selection includes CWPEn, Line Length (LL), BubbEn, MSWPEn, MFDFA (Max), Hjorth Complexity, SVDEn, MFDFA (Width), MFDFA (Mean), MFDFA (Peak), MFDFA (Fluctuation), AttEn.

This association could be mechanistically explained by the structural and functional connections between the prefrontal cortex, which plays a central role in cognitive control, and the cardiovascular system. In this regard, the role of afferent neural activity from arterial baroreceptors during the two different cardiac phases (diastole and systole) has received great interest. According to the baroreceptor hypothesis, increased ventricular pressure during the systole phase intensifies the afferent signals from the baroreceptor, thereby depleting mental resources and inhibiting cortical activity. While some have indeed found the systole phase exhibiting an inhibiting effect, supporting the aforementioned hypothesis, other studies have observed that participants performed better in tasks of cognitive control when stimuli were presented in the systole phase. As such, this study aimed to clarify the conflicting findings regarding the impact of the cardiac phase on cognitive function. Instead of using the conventional dichotomous method that contrasts only the average performance indices of each phase, we adopt a continuous modeling approach to better capture its non-linear effect on cognitive control.","tags":["Deception"],"title":"A Closer Look at Cardiac Contraction and the Effect of Cardiac Timing on Cognitive Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique-Makowski","ZenJuen-Lau","Tam-Pham","Te An Shu","Annabel Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1652918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652918400,"objectID":"11f9c7acf9f7141c4e396670d359d31e","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2022_restingstatecomplexity/","publishdate":"2022-05-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_restingstatecomplexity/","section":"publication","summary":"Resting state electroencephalogram (rsEEG) is a non-invasive and inexpensive measure of neural activity, with rest presenting a unique, individual-specific condition (i.e., situation-independent) for tapping into the spontaneous cognitive processes associated with the organized baseline state of the brain.

In recent years, EEG analysis has advanced beyond spectral analyses to include methods drawn from nonlinear dynamics to capture the complexity of the brain. While there is an abundance of studies studying rsEEG complexity in neuropathology in the pursuit of achieving better diagnostic outcomes, its correlates with the conscious experience of individuals in healthy populations still remain unclear.

Specifically, previous studies have shown that the superior and inferior portions of the cerebellum are involved in diferent verbal working memory (WM) mechanisms as part of two separate cerebro-cerebellar loops for articulatory rehearsal and phonological storage mechanisms. In comparison, our understanding of the involvement of the cerebellum in visual WM remains limited. We have previously shown that performance in verbal WM is disrupted by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the right superior cerebellum. The present study aimed to expand on this notion by exploring whether the inferior cerebellum is similarly involved in visual WM. Here, we used fMRI-guided, double-pulse TMS to probe the necessity of left superior and left inferior cerebellum in visual WM. We first conducted an fMRI localizer using the Sternberg visual WM task, which yielded targets in left superior and inferior cerebellum. Subsequently, TMS stimulation of these regions at the end of the encoding phase resulted in decreased accuracy in the visual WM task. Differences in the visual WM deficits caused by stimulation of superior and inferior left cerebellum raise the possibility that these regions are involved in different stages of visual WM.","tags":["Cerebellum"],"title":"Cerebellar Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Impairs Visual Working Memory","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"\n","date":1648425600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648425600,"objectID":"5b29d79fd32cf1b685361f047c64b5bf","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/post/role-play/","publishdate":"2022-03-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/role-play/","section":"post","summary":"Looking for Young Adults for a Role-play Study","tags":["Role-play"],"title":"Young Adults Needed","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Now Open for Applications\nThe Clinical Brain Lab, led by Principal Investigator Prof. Annabel Chen, is looking to hire 3 part-time undergraduate research assistants (10 hours/week) to assist with the recruitment and data collection of two neuroimaging studies.\nYou will be part of a dynamic team of researchers who are using cutting-edge functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the brain and behaviour of adults and children when presented with different Singaporean cultural stimuli.\nJob Scope Depending on your goals for joining us, you will be involved in some of the following activities:\nAdministrative support for recruitment and screening of participants Assist with data collection using fNIRS and MRI equipment Assist with contacting participants and collating questionnaire responses Data preprocessing of MRI and fNIRS datasets Other activities that support the research studies Requirements You must be a current undergraduate student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Fast learner and eager to acquire advanced neuroimaging data collection skills Ability to work on some weekends (for data collection) Previous experience in neuroimaging research is an advantage Apply If you are interested in this job opening, please contact:\nPrincipal Investigator: Prof. Annabel Chen Shen-Hsing Tel: +65 6908 1457 Email:annabelchen@ntu.edu.sg\nResearch Fellow: Dr. Atiqah Azhari Email:nuratiqah.azhari@ntu.edu.sg\n","date":1644534000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644534000,"objectID":"5bd975b5d6c112218e3681be5425a61e","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/join/join_cbl_part-time-ra/","publishdate":"2022-02-11T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/join/join_cbl_part-time-ra/","section":"join","summary":"Now Open for Applications\nThe Clinical Brain Lab, led by Principal Investigator Prof. Annabel Chen, is looking to hire 3 part-time undergraduate research assistants (10 hours/week) to assist with the recruitment and data collection of two neuroimaging studies.","tags":null,"title":"Part-time Student Assistant Position at The Clinical Brain Lab","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Follow this link for more information.\n","date":1639094400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639094400,"objectID":"62d5cfb800a58046277d409cabef4a1c","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/talk/2021_submission_sensors/","publishdate":"2021-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2021_submission_sensors/","section":"talk","summary":"Follow this link for more information.","tags":["Submission"],"title":"Calling for Submissions to Special Issue \"Brain Activity Monitoring and Measurement\"","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Sagarika Bhattacharjee1","Rajan Kashyap","Alicia M.

Age and sex might affect current density at target ROI due to their impact on cortical anatomy. The present tDCS simulation study investigates the effects of cortical anatomical parameters (volumes, dimension, and torque) on simulated tDCS current density in healthy young, middle-aged, and older males and females. Methodology: Individualized head models from 240 subjects (120 males, 18-87 years of age) were used to identify the estimated current density (2mA current intensity, 25cm2 electrode) from two simulated tDCS montages (CP5_CZ and F3_FP2) targeting the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), respectively. Cortical parameters including segmented brain volumes (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], grey and white matter), cerebral-dimensions (length/ width \u0026length/height) and brain-torque (front and back shift, petalia, and bending) were measured using the magnetic resonance images (MRIs) from each subject. The present study estimated sex differences in current density at these target ROIs mediated by these cortical parameters within each age group. Results: For both tDCS montages, females in the older age group received higher current density than their male counterparts at the target ROIs. No sex differences were observed in the middle-aged group. Males in the younger age group had a higher current density than females, only for the parietal montage. Across all age groups, CSF, and grey matter volumes significantly predicted the current intensity estimated at the target sites.

Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the presence of sex differences in the simulated tDCS current density, however this pattern differed across age groups and stimulation locations.

The objective is to stimulate the target region of interest (ROI) while minimizing the current in non-target ROIs (the ‘focality’ of tDCS). For this purpose, determining the appropriate current dose for an individual is difficult. Aim: To introduce a dose–target determination index (DTDI) to quantify the focality of tDCS and examine the dose–focality relationship in three different populations. Method: Here, we extended our previous toolbox i-SATA to the MNI reference space. After a tDCS montage is simulated for a current dose, the i-SATA(MNI) computes the average (over voxels) current density for every region in the brain. DTDI is the ratio of the average current density at the target ROI to the ROI with a maximum value (the peak region). Ideally, target ROI should be the peak region, so DTDI shall range from 0 to 1. The higher the value, the better the dose. We estimated the variation of DTDI within and across individuals using T1-weighted brain images of 45 males and females distributed equally across three age groups: (a) young adults (20 ≤ x \u003c 40 years), (b) mid adults (40 ≤ x \u003c 60 years), and (c) older adults (60 ≤ x \u003c 80 years). DTDI’s were evaluated for the frontal montage with electrodes at F3 and the right supraorbital for three current doses of 1 mA, 2 mA, and 3 mA, with the target ROI at the left middle frontal gyrus. Result: As the dose is incremented, DTDI may show (a) increase, (b) decrease, and (c) no change across the individuals depending on the relationship (nonlinear or linear) between the injected tDCS current and the distribution of current density in the target ROI. The nonlinearity is predominant in older adults with a decrease in focality. The decline is stronger in males. Higher current dose at older age can enhance the focality of stimulation. Conclusion: DTDI provides information on which tDCS current dose will optimize the focality of stimulation. The recommended DTDI dose should be prioritized based on the age (\u003e40 years) and sex (especially for males) of an individual. The toolbox i-SATA(MNI) is freely available.","tags":["tDCS"],"title":"Focality-Oriented Selection of Current Dose for Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["ZenJuen-Lau","Tam-Pham","Annabel Chen","Dominique-Makowski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1631491200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631491200,"objectID":"6bd74eb3bb8162055a46181b77bea1d2","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2021_braincomplexity/","publishdate":"2021-09-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_braincomplexity/","section":"publication","summary":"While electroencephalography (EEG) signals are commonly examined using conventional linear methods, there has been an increasing trend towards the use of complexity analysis in quantifying neural activity. On top of revealing complex neuronal processes of the brain that may not be possible with linear approaches, EEG complexity measures have also demonstrated their potential as biomarkers of psychopathology such as depression and schizophrenia. Unfortunately, the opacity of algorithms and descriptions originating from mathematical concepts have made it difficult to understand what complexity is and how to draw consistent conclusions when applied within psychology and neuropsychiatry research. In this review, we provide an overview and entry-level explanation of existing EEG complexity measures, which can be broadly categorized as measures of predictability and regularity. We then synthesize complexity findings across different areas of psychological science, namely in consciousness research, mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as changes across the lifespan, while addressing some theoretical and methodological issues underlying the discrepancies in the data.

However, despite their historical and theoretical importance as psychological stimuli, there is no dedicated software, nor consistent approach, to generate and report illusions in a systemic fashion. Illusory stimuli are often manually crafted or obtained via pre-made images, making it increasingly difficult for researchers to reproduce visual illusion paradigms and to properly measure the invoked sensitivity. In order to address replicability and reproducibility issues in illusion-based research, we present the Pyllusion package, a Python-based open-source software (freely available at https://github.com/RealityBending/Pyllusion), that implements a parametric framework to manipulate, generate, and report illusions in a systematic way. It is a flexible programming-based tool, as it can be easily incorporated with experimental software (such as PsychoPy) or pre-generated as image files (with the option of different output formats i.e., .png, .jpg, .tiff, etc.). Currently, our parametric approach accommodates several different illusions, especially classical ones such as the Ebbinghaus, Delboeuf, Ponzo, and Müller-Lyer illusions, and the addition of new illusions will be continually integrated as community needs evolve. With Pyllusion, we hope to facilitate a better understanding of critical processes underlying conscious perception and the associated underpinnings of psychopathology.","tags":["Deception"],"title":"A Parametric Framework to Generate Visual Illusions using Python","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tam-Pham","ZenJuen-Lau","Annabel Chen","Dominique-Makowski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1623196800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623196800,"objectID":"9dc8ccd17cb915a558b190e6a4ee09d2","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2021_hrv/","publishdate":"2021-06-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_hrv/","section":"publication","summary":"The use of heart rate variability (HRV) in research has been greatly popularized over the past decades due to the ease and affordability of HRV collection, coupled with its clinical relevance and significant relationships with psychophysiological constructs and psychopathological disorders. Despite the wide use of electrocardiograms (ECG) in research and advancements in sensor technology, the analytical approach and steps applied to obtain HRV measures can be seen as complex. Thus, this poses a challenge to users who may not have the adequate background knowledge to obtain the HRV indices reliably. To maximize the impact of HRV-related research and its reproducibility, parallel advances in users’ understanding of the indices and the standardization of analysis pipelines in its utility will be crucial. This paper addresses this gap and aims to provide an overview of the most up-to-date and commonly used HRV indices, as well as common research areas in which these indices have proven to be very useful, particularly in psychology.

Our findings suggest the existence of four distinct latent dimensions to lying, namely frequency, ability, negativity, and contextuality. We establish the convergent validity of our measure of lying by showing significant relationships with social desirability, malevolent traits, cognitive control deficits, normal and pathological personality traits, as well as demographic variables such as sex, age, and religiosity.

Previous studies acknowledge abnormalities within and beyond the fronto-striato-limbic circuit in OCD that require further clarifications. However, limited information could be inferred from the conventional way of investigating the functional connectivity differences between OCD and healthy controls. Here, we identified altered brain organization in patients with OCD by applying individual-based approaches to maximize the identification of underlying network-based features specific to the OCD group. rsfMRI of 20 patients with OCD and 22 controls were preprocessed, and individual-fMRI-subspace was derived for each subject within each group. We evaluated group differences in functional connectivity using individual-fMRI-subspace and established its advantage over conventional-fMRI methodology. We applied prediction-based approaches to highlight the group differences by evaluating the differences in functional connections that predicted the clinical scores (namely, the Obsessive–Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale). Then, we explored the brain network organization of both groups by estimating the subject-specific communities within each group. Lastly, we evaluated associations between the inter-individual variation of nodes in the communities to clinical measures using linear regression. Functional connectivity analysis using individual-fMRI-subspace detected 83 connections that were different between OCD and control groups, compared to none found using conventional-fMRI methodology. Connectome-based prediction analysis did not show significant overlap between the two groups in the functional connections that predicted the clinical scores. This suggests that the functional architecture in patients with OCD may be different compared to controls. Seven communities were found in both groups. Interestingly, within the OCD group but not controls, we observed functional connectivity between cerebellar and visual regions, and lack of connectivity between striato-limbic and frontal areas. Inter-individual variations in the community-size of these two communities were also associated with the OCI-R score (p \u003c .005). Due to our small sample size, we further validated our results by (i) accounting for head motion, (ii) applying global signal regression (GSR) in data processing, and (iii) using an alternate atlas for parcellation. While the main results were consistently observed with accounting for head motion and using another atlas, the key findings were not reproduced with GSR application. The study demonstrated the existence of disconnectedness in fronto-striato-limbic community and connectedness between cerebellar and visual areas in OCD patients, which was also related to the clinical symptomatology of OCD.","tags":["Cerebellum","OCD"],"title":"Individual-fMRI-approaches reveal cerebellum and visual communities to be functionally connected in obsessive compulsive disorder","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hengshuang Liu","Makoto Miyakoshi","Toshiharu Naka","Annabel Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1608508800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608508800,"objectID":"ee1f2cb9f51e856b66e5e90e4c12c67a","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2020_ageing-adutiroy-processing/","publishdate":"2020-12-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_ageing-adutiroy-processing/","section":"publication","summary":"The efficacy of listening comprehension is presumably sustained over the life span, contradicting the stereotype of universal cognitive decline.

Previous research indicates that pathway recruitment in bilinguals depends on a script’s orthographic depth and a reader’s proficiency with it. The effect of tDCS on each reading pathway has not been investigated in bilinguals. We stimulated the left dorsal and ventral pathways separately in Chinese-English (C-E) bilinguals to understand whether pathway-specific modulation by tDCS is possible and, if so, how it is influenced by orthographic depth and script proficiency. Methods: A double-blind, sham-controlled, within-subject experiment was designed wherein 16 balanced bilinguals received anodal tDCS in dorsal, ventral and sham sessions. Two tDCS montages of electrode sizes 5 x 5 cm2 with 1) anode at CP5 and cathode at CZ, and 2) anode at TP7 and cathode at nape of the neck, were applied for stimulating the dorsal and ventral pathways respectively. Bilinguals were asked to read word lists for each language before and after stimulation. RTs for accurate trials were analysed using linear mixed-effect modelling that included proficiency scores for reading English pseudo-words (PW) and Chinese pinyin. Results: For both languages, word reading RTs were faster following dorsal pathway stimulation. The dorsal stimulation effect (change in RT) was negatively correlated with pseudoword reading and pinyin proficiency. Stimulation of the ventral pathway decreased RTs only for Chinese reading. Conclusion: Dorsal and ventral reading pathways can be selectively modulated by tDCS in bilingual readers with dorsal (sub-lexical) pathway stimulation affecting reading in both scripts and ventral (lexical) pathway stimulation selectively affecting Chinese reading. Dorsal pathway tDCS effects are modulated by sub-lexical reading proficiency.","tags":["Learning","Biliteracy","tDCS"],"title":"Reading proficiency influences the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation: Evidence from selective modulation of dorsal and ventral pathways of reading in bilinguals","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Now Open for Applications\nThe Centre for Lifelong Learning and Individualised Cognition (CLIC), funded by the National Research Foundation (NRF) in Singapore and coordinated through the Cambridge Centre for Advanced Research and Education in Singapore (CARES), is a collaboration between Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the University of Cambridge.

Indeed, it has become increasingly apparent that the COVID-19 fake news pandemic is becoming just as viral as the outbreak of the disease itself, evidenced by the need for researchers and authorities to track the spread of misinformation. As a consequence, the Ministry of Health in Singapore has even dedicated an entire website (See here: https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/clarifications) to debunk all instances of fake news.\nThe Role of Conspiracy Theories While the authorities are struggling to provide concrete explanations about the coronavirus, conspiracy theorists are quick to provide competing ones with confidence. This has exaggerated the spread of fake news and conspiracy theories - beliefs that seek to explain the cause of an event by a hidden, wicked and unlawful scheme, without scientific support. For instance, a theory that the new 5G technology causes the spread of coronavirus outbreak was widely circulated and peddled by conspiracy theorists. Studies have shown that conspiracy theories are often endorsed by people who feel powerless. Their rejection of mainstream accounts and adoption of conspiracy explanations is an attempt to make sense of the world beyond their control (Swami \u0026amp; Furnham, 2010). The uncertainties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic might prompt people, especially individuals with higher schizotypal tendencies (characterized by suspicion, social anxiety and paranoid ideation), to engage in this sense-making mechanism, seeking alternative explanations to regain their sense of control. People who have the tendency to adopt conspiracy theories have been found to rely more on intuition (Pennycook, Cheyne, Barr, Koehler \u0026amp; Fugelsang, 2015; Pennycook \u0026amp; Rand, 2018) and are hence more susceptible to fake news beliefs.\nThe Role of Emotions In a global pandemic where the world is in a constant elevated state of anxiety, fake news beliefs can befall anyone for reasons beyond just the persistent cognitive biases that characterize conspiracist theorists. People are often left feeling fearful and anxious due to the endless bombardment of pandemic news information, regardless of its accuracy. Fake news on COVID-19 are especially emotionally engaging because they play on people’s helplessness by offering some miracle remedy or fueling anger towards authorities handling the situation.\nA research team led by Gordon Pennycook, a researcher on the psychology of misinformation, found that individuals are more likely to perceive fake news headlines as accurate when they were in an emotional state (Martel et al., 2019). At the Clinical Brain Lab, we have started research into this area during the Circuit Breaker period. We propose that the underlying factor driving susceptibility to fake news beliefs is not just the mere presence of negative affect, but how one regulates these emotions. This refers to the ability to control one’s emotional state, such as considering alternative interpretations of an otherwise negative situation.\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, an important aspect of emotion regulation is being able to navigate through the uncertainties of the future. With future plans now at a standstill and emotions running high, we become less tolerant of uncertainty and feel more helpless about our circumstances. Poor self-control makes us cognitively lazy, believing something because “it feels right” and aligned with our emotions. Fast, intuitive processing thus often takes precedence over effortful and reflective thinking, of which the latter is needed to discern whether a piece of news is real or fake (Pennycook \u0026amp; Rand, 2019). We are thus more vulnerable to engaging in fake news than we think.\nOur Research As it is important to delineate the psychological determinants of the belief in fake news as part of a global effort in combating misinformation, Prof Annabel Chen together with Research Fellow Dr Dominique Makowski and research assistants (Pham Thanh Tam and Lau Zen Juen) are currently conducting an investigation into the spread of COVID-19 fake news in Singapore. Specifically, this study seeks to examine whether the belief in conspiracy theories and one’s ability to regulate emotions are related to one’s tendency to fall prey to fake news. This study is pre-registered at OSF and currently undergoing data analysis.\n","date":1600387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600387200,"objectID":"85dc60021238af40d10b624977773cfa","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2020_deception-covid-fakenews/","publishdate":"2020-09-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_deception-covid-fakenews/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study, we seek to examine whether the belief in conspiracy theories and one’s ability to regulate emotions are related to one’s tendency to fall prey to fake news.","tags":["Deception"],"title":"Psychological Determinants of the Susceptibility to Fake News amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Annabel Chen","XiaoQin","Elias-Ebrahimzadeh","ChiaLun-Liu","Teo Jia Li","Winlynn"],"categories":null,"content":"Our projects seek to make cognitive neuroscience findings accessible to educators and facilitate collaborative work between educators and researchers. As technology and globalisation are changing the nature of labour markets and increasing the demand for high levels of skill, the need for individuals to be able to develop new skills during their working careers is becoming increasingly pressing. While there is an increased recognition of the need for flexible behavioural and transferable skills, there is currently a gap in evidence-based training programmes that can effectively support and promote cognitive flexibility across the life course.\nThe Centre for Lifelong Learning and Individualised Cognition (CLIC) programme aims to address this gap by developing innovative research in the science of learning and translating it to educational and real-life applications across the life course.

However, such physiological arousal may merely be reflecting anxiety and fear during a polygraph examination, rather than lying per se.\nAs physiological arousal could not be used to accurately infer lying, researchers are urged to further look into the mental processes related to lying. To date, different neurophysiological signals, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERP) have been studied for possible application to index deception. Past studies have shown evidences that strongly supporting the hypothesis that deception requires the coordination of multiple cognitive processes and thus is more cognitively taxing than truth telling. Despite the positive findings, previous studies were often criticized for not capturing lying as it exists in the real world. Indeed, majority of the experimental paradigms required participants to lie about perceptual stimuli or memorized materials. More importantly, unlike lying in the real world, the lies generated in research labs were often not spontaneous but instructed.\nTo increase the translational value of the research in deception and lie detection, we aim to investigate the neural correlates of lying using paradigms that can elicit lying similar to those in the real world. In addition, we also seek to explore the structure of dispositional deception by developing and validating a short and reliable questionnaire to characterize individuals\u0026rsquo; lying patterns.\n","date":1596499200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596499200,"objectID":"c0c3b88fad3869d25cb4e0b1701dc290","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/project/deception/","publishdate":"2020-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/deception/","section":"project","summary":"An investigation of deception and trust.","tags":["Deception"],"title":"Behevioural and Neural Correlates of Deception","type":"project"},{"authors":["Chiao-Yi Wu","Rajan Kashyap","Nestor Vinas-Guasch","Sagarika Bhattacharjee","Lin Hsin-Yu","Teo Jia Li","LiTong-Low","Arum","Annabel Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"Our projects aim to elucidate the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying typical and impaired reading in bilinguals.

The distribution of the electric current induced in the brain due to tDCS is provided by simulation toolbox like Realistic-volumetric-Approach-based-Simulator-for-Transcranial-electric-stimulation (ROAST). However, the procedure to estimate the total current density induced at the target and the intermediary region of the cortex is complex. The Systematic-Approach-for-tDCS-Analysis (SATA) was developed to overcome this problem. However, SATA is limited to standardized headspace only. Here we develop individual-SATA (i-SATA) to extend it to individual head. Method: T1-weighted images of 15 subjects were taken from two Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners of different strengths. Across the subjects, the montages were simulated in ROAST. i-SATA converts the ROAST output to Talairach space. The x, y and z coordinates of the anterior commissure (AC), posterior commissure (PC), and Mid-Sagittal (MS) points are necessary for the conversion. AC and PC are detected using the acpcdetect toolbox. We developed a method to determine the MS in the image and cross-verified its location manually using BrainSight. Result: Determination of points with i-SATA is fast and accurate. The i-SATA provided estimates of the current-density induced across an individual’s cortical lobes and gyri as tested on images from two different scanners. Conclusion: Researchers can use i-SATA for customizing tDCS-montages. With i-SATA it is also easier to compute the inter-individual variation in current-density across the target and intermediary regions of the brain.

If the two pathways are stimulated simultaneously, the function of dorsal pathway (predominantly used for graphophonological conversion) might interfere with the function of the ventral pathway (used for semantics), and vice-versa. To achieve functional specificity in tDCS for investigating the two pathways of reading, it is important to stimulate each pathway per session such that the spread of current across the cortical areas due to the two montages has minimal overlap. The present study intends to achieve this by introducing a systematic approach for tDCS analysis. We employed the COMETS2 software to simulate 10 montage configurations (5 for each pathway) for three electrode sizes: 5x5, 3x3, and 5x7cm2. This diversity in montage configuration is chosen since previous studies found the position and the size of anode and cathode to play an important role. The values of the magnitude of current density (MCD) obtained from the configuration were used to calculate: (i) average MCD in each cortical lobe, (ii) number of overlapping coordinates, and (iii) cortical areas with high MCD. The measures (i) and (iii) ascertained the current spread by each montage within a cortical lobe, and (ii) verified the overlap of the spread of current between a pair of montages. The analyses show that a montage using the electrode size of 5x5cm2 with the anode at CP5 and cathode at CZ, and another with anode at TP7 and cathode at nape of the neck are optimal choices for dorsal and ventral pathways, respectively. To verify, we cross-validated the results with ROAST. This systematic approach was helpful in reducing the ambiguity of montage selection prior to conducting a tDCS study.","tags":["tDCS"],"title":"Simulation analyses of tDcS montages for the investigation of dorsal and ventral pathways","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Description Complex Span is a PsychoPy implementation of a working memory span task, adapted from Gonthier et al.

TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) is a non-invasive and painless tool that modulates neural activity. It works on the principle of Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. In TMS, an electromagnetic coil sends a perpendicular magnetic field into the region of interest on the scalp. This field indirectly influences neuronal activity. TMS has been shown in some cases to induce cortical excitability and in some cases to depress excitability. TMS can be administered in bursts at a rhythmic frequency (repetitive TMS) or as a single pulse. Repetitive TMS has been shown to have a greater and lasting effect. Depending on the question, rapid or slow repetitive TMS can be administered.\nHow is TMS Done? An electromyography (EMG) module is first attached via a wristband and by pasting electrodes onto the participant.\nAfter setting up the parameters, an experimenter positions the magnetic coil above the participant’s scalp, over the region of interest. When activated, a high-current pulse is produced in the TMS coil, inducing a perpendicular magnetic field. As high-current pulses are sent through the coil, the participant may hear clicks.\nWhat is TMS used for? TMS can be used to treat clinical conditions (such as drug-resistant depression) or be used as an experimental technique to understand brain functions.

Two cerebro-cerebellar networks for verbal working memory have been proposed: (1) fronto-superior cerebellar network associated with controlling and updating speech-related information, and (2) parieto-inferior cerebellar network associated with storing speech-related information briefly. Sobczak-Edmans and colleagues (2019) examined the structural and functional connectivity of these cerebro-cerebellar networks. Using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography, they reconstructed white matter tracts in: (1) the left inferior frontal gyrus via the pons to the right superior cerebellum, and (2) the left inferior parietal lobule via the pons to the right inferior cerebellum. They also found that greater structural connectivity of the ponto-superior cerebellar tract was correlated with slower response time for verbal working memory. This study provides support to the two cerebro-cerebellar networks and suggests that the structural connectivity of the networks relates functionally to verbal working memory.","tags":["Cerebellum","Working Memory","fMRI"],"title":"Cerebro-cerebellar pathways for verbal working memory","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2018.\n","date":1529625600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529625600,"objectID":"0601f3d5cbcc51d79e89f28b06599f3a","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/talk/2018_brainconnects/","publishdate":"2018-06-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2018_brainconnects/","section":"talk","summary":"Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2018.","tags":["BrainConnects"],"title":"BrainConnects 2018","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jo A.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brain connectivity of 22 women and 24 men were imaged when they completed two tasks in a 3 Tesla MRI scanner. One task involved holding visuospatial information in short-term memory and the other task involved ignoring irrelevant information. We found that women who felt more stressed over the last month were faster at performing the memory task, but men did not show this relationship. Stress was also related to co-activation of brain regions, referred to as functional connectivity, in both women and men: higher stress was associated with increased connectivity between some brain regions but decreased connectivity between other brain regions. Our findings support past findings that women tend to use emotionally focused coping strategies (that is trying to regulate our mood) when stressed, but challenges previous reports that men tend to seek reward (such as alcohol) when stressed. Overall, the study provides evidence that perceived stress has subtle effects on our thinking and brain functions.","tags":["Stress","Working Memory","fMRI"],"title":"Functional connectivity of resting-state, working memory and inhibition networks in perceived stress","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gladys Heng","Chiao-Yi Wu","Jo A.

This pattern of brain organization is known as brain lateralization. However, studies have suggested that brain lateralization is less prominent in older adults. In other words, older adults recruit additional resources from the other side of the brain to achieve similar cognitive functions as with young adults. Heng and colleagues (2017) further examined age-related differences in brain lateralization during language and visuospatial processing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the researchers recorded the brain activation of 16 older (60s) and 21 younger (20s) Japanese adults when the participants judged if two characters/sets of lines had similar or different pronunciations/orientations. Compared with young adults, older adults were slower but equally accurate at making the judgments. When judging language pronunciations, older adults showed greater activation and reduced brain lateralization only in the frontal brain area that is crucially involved in language sound processing, and not meaning.  As this frontal brain area is necessary for judging language pronunciations, the additional recruitment of this brain region on the other side of the brain is suggested to help in maintaining performance accuracy. Results therefore highlight the importance of considering the functional specificity of brain regions when studying age-related differences in cognitive processes.","tags":["Ageing","fMRI"],"title":"The role of regional heterogeneity in age-related differences in functional hemispheric asymmetry: an fMRI study","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2017.\n","date":1503360000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1503360000,"objectID":"d6243c7893d53d7577c464150b39066b","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/talk/2017_brainconnects/","publishdate":"2017-08-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2017_brainconnects/","section":"talk","summary":"Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2017.","tags":["BrainConnects"],"title":"BrainConnects 2017","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Shu-Hui Lee","Zachary Walker","James B.

Results suggest that dissociable dorsal cognitive (cool) and ventral affective (hot) frontal-subcortical circuits (FSC) work together to govern social relationships, with repeated social consequences leading to potentially adaptive - or maladaptive - relationships that can become routinized in the cerebellum.

Differentiated instruction has been offered to help teachers accommodate diverse learners, but most instructional strategies are typically directed at compensating for - not remediating - cognitive and academic skill deficits. This differentiated instruction approach is contrasted with the extant learning science and educational neuroscience literature, which suggests early intervention and remediation of skill deficits is the preferred evidence-based practice. To overcome these competing and apparently contradictory positions, we argue children should be provided with systematic brain-based differentiated instruction in inclusive classrooms to prevent skill deficits, with compensatory accommodations provided only as necessary to help children access the general education curriculum. For those who continue to struggle, we argue remedial efforts should occur outside of, and in addition to, inclusive general education instruction, given the empirical evidence supporting both practices. Implications for training and system-level reform will be addressed.","tags":["Science of Learning"],"title":"Reconciling individual differences with collective needs: The juxtaposition of sociopolitical and neuroscience perspectives on remediation and compensation of student skill deficits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

In contrast, a distributed network of bilateral inferior frontal and inferior temporal areas, and bilateral superior (lobule VI) and inferior (lobule VIIB) cerebellar areas, was recruited during visual working memory. Results of the study verified that a distinct cross cerebro-cerebellar circuitry underlies verbal working memory.

Recent work has shown the influential role of the salience network over the default mode network (DMN) and executive control network (ECN). This study comprehensively investigates age-related changes in intra- and internetwork connectivity and effective connectivity between the DMN, ECN, and salience network across the adult life span. Two hundred ten participants completed a working memory task, an inhibition task, and a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Networks were extracted using independent component analysis; then, regression analyses and t-tests between three age groups, 21-40 (younger), 41-60 (middle), and 61-80 (older), were conducted. Older age was associated with decreased intranetwork connectivity. Functional network connectivity analyses revealed older age was associated with increased internetwork connectivity between the salience network and the ECNs and DMNs. In both cases, the effects were more pronounced in the tasks compared to resting state. Granger causality analyses indicated the salience network was influenced by the DMN and ECN in all age groups during both tasks, but not rest. However, middle adults showed increased influence from the salience network to the right ECN compared to younger adults during the flanker task. Taking everything into account, these findings indicate the role of the salience network changes over the life span, which may have implications for the early detection of pathophysiology in older adults.","tags":["Ageing","fMRI"],"title":"A comprehensive analysis of connectivity and aging over the adult life span","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Monika Sobczak-Edmans","H.

However, the cerebro-cerebellar network for visual working memory is not as well defined. Our previous fMRI study showed superior and inferior cerebellar activations during a block design visual working memory task, but specific cerebellar contributions to cognitive processes in encoding, maintenance and retrieval have not yet been established. The current study examined cerebellar contributions to each of the components of visual working memory and presence of cerebellar hemispheric laterality was investigated. 40 young adults performed a Sternberg visual working memory task during fMRI scanning using a parametric paradigm. The contrast between high and low memory load during each phase was examined. We found that the most prominent activation was observed in vermal lobule VIIIb and bilateral lobule VI during encoding. Using a quantitative laterality index, we found that left-lateralized activation of lobule VIIIa was present in the encoding phase. In the maintenance phase, there was bilateral lobule VI and right-lateralized lobule VIIb activity. Changes in activation in right lobule VIIIa were present during the retrieval phase. The current results provide evidence that superior and inferior cerebellum contributes to visual working memory, with a tendency for left-lateralized activations in the inferior cerebellum during encoding and right-lateralized lobule VIIb activations during maintenance. The results of the study are in agreement with Baddeley’s multi-component working memory model, but also suggest that stored visual representations are additionally supported by maintenance mechanisms that may employ verbal coding.","tags":["Cerebellum","Working Memory","fMRI"],"title":"Temporal dynamics of visual working memory","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2015.\n","date":1438300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438300800,"objectID":"1690d2192fda472c26a847c074fd93c9","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/talk/2015_brainconnects/","publishdate":"2015-07-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2015_brainconnects/","section":"talk","summary":"Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2015.","tags":["BrainConnects"],"title":"BrainConnects 2015","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2014.\n","date":1406851200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1406851200,"objectID":"46351a4d6cd9cd6b53097ebd9c0fad78","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/talk/2014_brainconnects/","publishdate":"2014-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2014_brainconnects/","section":"talk","summary":"Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2014.","tags":["BrainConnects"],"title":"BrainConnects 2014","type":"talk"}]
