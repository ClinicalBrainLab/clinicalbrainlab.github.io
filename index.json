Indeed, it has become increasingly apparent that the COVID-19 fake news pandemic is becoming just as viral as the outbreak of the disease itself, evidenced by the need for researchers and authorities to track the spread of misinformation. As a consequence, the Ministry of Health in Singapore has even dedicated an entire website (See here: https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/clarifications) to debunk all instances of fake news.\nThe Role of Conspiracy Theories While the authorities are struggling to provide concrete explanations about the coronavirus, conspiracy theorists are quick to provide competing ones with confidence. This has exaggerated the spread of fake news and conspiracy theories - beliefs that seek to explain the cause of an event by a hidden, wicked and unlawful scheme, without scientific support. For instance, a theory that the new 5G technology causes the spread of coronavirus outbreak was widely circulated and peddled by conspiracy theorists. Studies have shown that conspiracy theories are often endorsed by people who feel powerless. Their rejection of mainstream accounts and adoption of conspiracy explanations is an attempt to make sense of the world beyond their control (Swami \u0026amp; Furnham, 2010). The uncertainties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic might prompt people, especially individuals with higher schizotypal tendencies (characterized by suspicion, social anxiety and paranoid ideation), to engage in this sense-making mechanism, seeking alternative explanations to regain their sense of control. People who have the tendency to adopt conspiracy theories have been found to rely more on intuition (Pennycook, Cheyne, Barr, Koehler \u0026amp; Fugelsang, 2015; Pennycook \u0026amp; Rand, 2018) and are hence more susceptible to fake news beliefs.\nThe Role of Emotions In a global pandemic where the world is in a constant elevated state of anxiety, fake news beliefs can befall anyone for reasons beyond just the persistent cognitive biases that characterize conspiracist theorists. People are often left feeling fearful and anxious due to the endless bombardment of pandemic news information, regardless of its accuracy. Fake news on COVID-19 are especially emotionally engaging because they play on people’s helplessness by offering some miracle remedy or fueling anger towards authorities handling the situation.\nA research team led by Gordon Pennycook, a researcher on the psychology of misinformation, found that individuals are more likely to perceive fake news headlines as accurate when they were in an emotional state (Martel et al., 2019). At the Clinical Brain Lab, we have started research into this area during the Circuit Breaker period. We propose that the underlying factor driving susceptibility to fake news beliefs is not just the mere presence of negative affect, but how one regulates these emotions. This refers to the ability to control one’s emotional state, such as considering alternative interpretations of an otherwise negative situation.\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, an important aspect of emotion regulation is being able to navigate through the uncertainties of the future. With future plans now at a standstill and emotions running high, we become less tolerant of uncertainty and feel more helpless about our circumstances. Poor self-control makes us cognitively lazy, believing something because “it feels right” and aligned with our emotions. Fast, intuitive processing thus often takes precedence over effortful and reflective thinking, of which the latter is needed to discern whether a piece of news is real or fake (Pennycook \u0026amp; Rand, 2019). We are thus more vulnerable to engaging in fake news than we think.\nOur Research As it is important to delineate the psychological determinants of the belief in fake news as part of a global effort in combating misinformation, Prof Annabel Chen together with Research Fellow Dr Dominique Makowski and research assistants (Pham Thanh Tam and Lau Zen Juen) are currently conducting an investigation into the spread of COVID-19 fake news in Singapore. Specifically, this study seeks to examine whether the belief in conspiracy theories and one’s ability to regulate emotions are related to one’s tendency to fall prey to fake news. This study is pre-registered at OSF and currently undergoing data analysis.\n","date":1600387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600387200,"objectID":"85dc60021238af40d10b624977773cfa","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2020_deception-covid-fakenews/","publishdate":"2020-09-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_deception-covid-fakenews/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study, we seek to examine whether the belief in conspiracy theories and one’s ability to regulate emotions are related to one’s tendency to fall prey to fake news.","tags":["Deception"],"title":"Psychological Determinants of the Susceptibility to Fake News amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","Tam Pham","Lau Zen Juen","Dayton Leow","Annabel Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"Traditional lie detection as used in polygraph test is based on examining one\u0026rsquo;s physiological arousal (measuring skin conductance, heart rate, and respiration) to infer lying. However, such physiological arousal may merely be reflecting anxiety and fear during a polygraph examination, rather than lying per se.\nAs physiological arousal could not be used to accurately infer lying, researchers are urged to further look into the mental processes related to lying. To date, different neurophysiological signals, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERP) have been studied for possible application to index deception. Past studies have shown evidences that strongly supporting the hypothesis that deception requires the coordination of multiple cognitive processes and thus is more cognitively taxing than truth telling. Despite the positive findings, previous studies were often criticized for not capturing lying as it exists in the real world. Indeed, majority of the experimental paradigms required participants to lie about perceptual stimuli or memorized materials. More importantly, unlike lying in the real world, the lies generated in research labs were often not spontaneous but instructed.\nTo increase the translational value of the research in deception and lie detection, we aim to investigate the neural correlates of lying using paradigms that can elicit lying similar to those in the real world. In addition, we also seek to explore the structure of dispositional deception by developing and validating a short and reliable questionnaire to characterize individuals' lying patterns.\n","date":1596499200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596499200,"objectID":"c0c3b88fad3869d25cb4e0b1701dc290","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/project/deception/","publishdate":"2020-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/deception/","section":"project","summary":"An investigation of deception and trust.","tags":["Deception"],"title":"Behevioural and Neural Correlates of Deception","type":"project"},{"authors":["Chiao-Yi Wu","Nestor Vinas-Gausch","Teo Jia Li","Li Tong Low","Annabel Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"We use a combination of behavioural assessment, neuroimaging techniques, and intervention to investigate the neural reading networks for bilingual readers from a variety of language profiles, across early childhood and adulthood.

Critically, and despite scientific evidence supporting the existence of individual differences in lying, a validated measure of dispositional deception is still lacking. This study aims to explore the structure of dispositional deception by developing and validating a short and reliable 16-item questionnaire to characterize the lying pattern of individuals. Our findings suggest the existence of four distinct latent dimensions to lying, namely frequency, ability, negativity, and contextuality. We establish the convergent validity of our measure of lying by showing significant relationships with social desirability, malevolent traits, cognitive control deficits, normal and pathological personality traits, as well as demographic variables such as sex, age, and religiosity. Overall, the present study introduces a general framework to understanding deception as a dispositional trait which future deception studies can build on, accounting for the inter-individual variability in lying.","tags":["Deception"],"title":"The Structure of Deception: Validation of the Lying Profile Questionnaire","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1596499200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596499200,"objectID":"004a3742f2b78b457f5bb2434d6d2079","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/post/dyslexia-biliteracy/","publishdate":"2020-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/dyslexia-biliteracy/","section":"post","summary":"Looking for Chinese-English Bilinguals who had a history of dyslexia or are struggling in reading.","tags":[],"title":"Volunteers Needed!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Rajan Kashyap","Sagarika Bhattacharjee","Ramaswamy Arumugam","Kenichi Oishi","John E.

The distribution of the electric current induced in the brain due to tDCS is provided by simulation toolbox like Realistic-volumetric-Approach-based-Simulator-for-Transcranial-electric-stimulation (ROAST). However, the procedure to estimate the total current density induced at the target and the intermediary region of the cortex is complex. The Systematic-Approach-for-tDCS-Analysis (SATA) was developed to overcome this problem. However, SATA is limited to standardized headspace only. Here we develop individual-SATA (i-SATA) to extend it to individual head. Method: T1-weighted images of 15 subjects were taken from two Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners of different strengths. Across the subjects, the montages were simulated in ROAST. i-SATA converts the ROAST output to Talairach space. The x, y and z coordinates of the anterior commissure (AC), posterior commissure (PC), and Mid-Sagittal (MS) points are necessary for the conversion. AC and PC are detected using the acpcdetect toolbox. We developed a method to determine the MS in the image and cross-verified its location manually using BrainSight. Result: Determination of points with i-SATA is fast and accurate. The i-SATA provided estimates of the current-density induced across an individual’s cortical lobes and gyri as tested on images from two different scanners. Conclusion: Researchers can use i-SATA for customizing tDCS-montages. With i-SATA it is also easier to compute the inter-individual variation in current-density across the target and intermediary regions of the brain. The software is publicly available.","tags":["Software"],"title":"i-SATA: A MATLAB based toolbox to estimate current density generated by transcranial direct current stimulation in an individual brain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sagarika Bhattacharjee","Rajan Kashyap","Turki Abualait","Annabel Chen","Woo-Kyoung Yoo","Shahid Bashir"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1584662400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584662400,"objectID":"0f424719d95dc9cef755b305b50be8f7","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2020_m1-review/","publishdate":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_m1-review/","section":"publication","summary":"The neuroscience community has widely acknowledged primary motor cortex as a region important for execution of voluntary motor movements.

The subgroup of healthy individuals had higher use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, illicit drugs, and had a predisposition towards antisocial personality problems.

If the two pathways are stimulated simultaneously, the function of dorsal pathway (predominantly used for graphophonological conversion) might interfere with the function of the ventral pathway (used for semantics), and vice-versa. To achieve functional specificity in tDCS for investigating the two pathways of reading, it is important to stimulate each pathway per session such that the spread of current across the cortical areas due to the two montages has minimal overlap. The present study intends to achieve this by introducing a systematic approach for tDCS analysis. We employed the COMETS2 software to simulate 10 montage configurations (5 for each pathway) for three electrode sizes: 5x5, 3x3, and 5x7cm2. This diversity in montage configuration is chosen since previous studies found the position and the size of anode and cathode to play an important role. The values of the magnitude of current density (MCD) obtained from the configuration were used to calculate: (i) average MCD in each cortical lobe, (ii) number of overlapping coordinates, and (iii) cortical areas with high MCD. The measures (i) and (iii) ascertained the current spread by each montage within a cortical lobe, and (ii) verified the overlap of the spread of current between a pair of montages. The analyses show that a montage using the electrode size of 5x5cm2 with the anode at CP5 and cathode at CZ, and another with anode at TP7 and cathode at nape of the neck are optimal choices for dorsal and ventral pathways, respectively. To verify, we cross-validated the results with ROAST. This systematic approach was helpful in reducing the ambiguity of montage selection prior to conducting a tDCS study.","tags":["tDCS"],"title":"Simulation analyses of tDcS montages for the investigation of dorsal and ventral pathways","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We are currently actively recruiting for PhD students interested in developing research in educational neuroscience, affective neuroscience and aging neuroscience (specifically in older neurological patients).\nJob Scope Research in the lab is focused on the neural basis of higher cognition in the cerebellum, cognitive training in healthy aging and we will be developing an area in Educational Neuroscience.

Two cerebro-cerebellar networks for verbal working memory have been proposed: (1) fronto-superior cerebellar network associated with controlling and updating speech-related information, and (2) parieto-inferior cerebellar network associated with storing speech-related information briefly. Sobczak-Edmans and colleagues (2019) examined the structural and functional connectivity of these cerebro-cerebellar networks. Using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography, they reconstructed white matter tracts in: (1) the left inferior frontal gyrus via the pons to the right superior cerebellum, and (2) the left inferior parietal lobule via the pons to the right inferior cerebellum. They also found that greater structural connectivity of the ponto-superior cerebellar tract was correlated with slower response time for verbal working memory. This study provides support to the two cerebro-cerebellar networks and suggests that the structural connectivity of the networks relates functionally to verbal working memory.","tags":["Cerebellum","Working Memory","fMRI"],"title":"Cerebro-cerebellar pathways for verbal working memory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jo A.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brain connectivity of 22 women and 24 men were imaged when they completed two tasks in a 3 Tesla MRI scanner. One task involved holding visuospatial information in short-term memory and the other task involved ignoring irrelevant information. We found that women who felt more stressed over the last month were faster at performing the memory task, but men did not show this relationship. Stress was also related to co-activation of brain regions, referred to as functional connectivity, in both women and men: higher stress was associated with increased connectivity between some brain regions but decreased connectivity between other brain regions. Our findings support past findings that women tend to use emotionally focused coping strategies (that is trying to regulate our mood) when stressed, but challenges previous reports that men tend to seek reward (such as alcohol) when stressed. Overall, the study provides evidence that perceived stress has subtle effects on our thinking and brain functions.","tags":["Stress","Working Memory","fMRI"],"title":"Functional connectivity of resting-state, working memory and inhibition networks in perceived stress","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gladys Heng","Chiao-Yi Wu","Jo A.

This pattern of brain organization is known as brain lateralization. However, studies have suggested that brain lateralization is less prominent in older adults. In other words, older adults recruit additional resources from the other side of the brain to achieve similar cognitive functions as with young adults. Heng and colleagues (2017) further examined age-related differences in brain lateralization during language and visuospatial processing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the researchers recorded the brain activation of 16 older (60s) and 21 younger (20s) Japanese adults when the participants judged if two characters/sets of lines had similar or different pronunciations/orientations. Compared with young adults, older adults were slower but equally accurate at making the judgments. When judging language pronunciations, older adults showed greater activation and reduced brain lateralization only in the frontal brain area that is crucially involved in language sound processing, and not meaning.  As this frontal brain area is necessary for judging language pronunciations, the additional recruitment of this brain region on the other side of the brain is suggested to help in maintaining performance accuracy. Results therefore highlight the importance of considering the functional specificity of brain regions when studying age-related differences in cognitive processes.","tags":["Ageing","fMRI"],"title":"The role of regional heterogeneity in age-related differences in functional hemispheric asymmetry: an fMRI study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shu-Hui Lee","Zachary Walker","James B.

This current cross-sectional study undertook a fMRI Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analyses to examine the neurocircuitry that governs emotional and behavioural functions critical for building effective social relationships in children and adults. Results suggest that dissociable dorsal cognitive (cool) and ventral affective (hot) frontal-subcortical circuits (FSC) work together to govern social relationships, with repeated social consequences leading to potentially adaptive - or maladaptive - relationships that can become routinized in the cerebellum. Implications for forming stable, functional, social bonds are considered, followed by recommendations for those who struggle with cool and hot FSC functioning that can hinder the development of adaptive prosocial relationships.","tags":["Meta-analysis"],"title":"Frontal-subcortical circuitry in social attachment and relationships: A cross-sectional fMRI ALE meta-analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James B.

Differentiated instruction has been offered to help teachers accommodate diverse learners, but most instructional strategies are typically directed at compensating for - not remediating - cognitive and academic skill deficits. This differentiated instruction approach is contrasted with the extant learning science and educational neuroscience literature, which suggests early intervention and remediation of skill deficits is the preferred evidence-based practice. To overcome these competing and apparently contradictory positions, we argue children should be provided with systematic brain-based differentiated instruction in inclusive classrooms to prevent skill deficits, with compensatory accommodations provided only as necessary to help children access the general education curriculum. For those who continue to struggle, we argue remedial efforts should occur outside of, and in addition to, inclusive general education instruction, given the empirical evidence supporting both practices. Implications for training and system-level reform will be addressed.","tags":["Science of Learning"],"title":"Reconciling individual differences with collective needs: The juxtaposition of sociopolitical and neuroscience perspectives on remediation and compensation of student skill deficits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

In contrast, a distributed network of bilateral inferior frontal and inferior temporal areas, and bilateral superior (lobule VI) and inferior (lobule VIIB) cerebellar areas, was recruited during visual working memory. Results of the study verified that a distinct cross cerebro-cerebellar circuitry underlies verbal working memory.

Recent work has shown the influential role of the salience network over the default mode network (DMN) and executive control network (ECN). This study comprehensively investigates age-related changes in intra- and internetwork connectivity and effective connectivity between the DMN, ECN, and salience network across the adult life span. Two hundred ten participants completed a working memory task, an inhibition task, and a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Networks were extracted using independent component analysis; then, regression analyses and t-tests between three age groups, 21-40 (younger), 41-60 (middle), and 61-80 (older), were conducted. Older age was associated with decreased intranetwork connectivity. Functional network connectivity analyses revealed older age was associated with increased internetwork connectivity between the salience network and the ECNs and DMNs. In both cases, the effects were more pronounced in the tasks compared to resting state. Granger causality analyses indicated the salience network was influenced by the DMN and ECN in all age groups during both tasks, but not rest. However, middle adults showed increased influence from the salience network to the right ECN compared to younger adults during the flanker task. Taking everything into account, these findings indicate the role of the salience network changes over the life span, which may have implications for the early detection of pathophysiology in older adults.","tags":["Ageing","fMRI"],"title":"A comprehensive analysis of connectivity and aging over the adult life span","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Monika Sobczak-Edmans","H.

However, the cerebro-cerebellar network for visual working memory is not as well defined. Our previous fMRI study showed superior and inferior cerebellar activations during a block design visual working memory task, but specific cerebellar contributions to cognitive processes in encoding, maintenance and retrieval have not yet been established. The current study examined cerebellar contributions to each of the components of visual working memory and presence of cerebellar hemispheric laterality was investigated. 40 young adults performed a Sternberg visual working memory task during fMRI scanning using a parametric paradigm. The contrast between high and low memory load during each phase was examined. We found that the most prominent activation was observed in vermal lobule VIIIb and bilateral lobule VI during encoding. Using a quantitative laterality index, we found that left-lateralized activation of lobule VIIIa was present in the encoding phase. In the maintenance phase, there was bilateral lobule VI and right-lateralized lobule VIIb activity. Changes in activation in right lobule VIIIa were present during the retrieval phase. The current results provide evidence that superior and inferior cerebellum contributes to visual working memory, with a tendency for left-lateralized activations in the inferior cerebellum during encoding and right-lateralized lobule VIIb activations during maintenance. The results of the study are in agreement with Baddeley’s multi-component working memory model, but also suggest that stored visual representations are additionally supported by maintenance mechanisms that may employ verbal coding.","tags":["Cerebellum","Working Memory","fMRI"],"title":"Temporal dynamics of visual working memory","type":"publication"}]
