He succeeded in being Ranked 1st Admitted Ph.D. of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Tehran, Iran in 2014 and received his Ph.D. degree, in 2019. During his Ph.D., his primary focus was on the localization of the epileptic foci using simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording in patients with epilepsy. Specifically, he developed a novel approach based on the ICA theory for this purpose. To enhance his knowledge and experience and get ready to accomplish high-quality research, he joined a research team at the University of Calgary, Canada, working on the same field as his Ph.D. thesis for his sabbatical as a scholar Ph.D. researcher. He also has a keen interest in research and education involving neurosciences, biomedical signal and image processing, artificial neural networks, statistical pattern recognition, system identification, bio electromagnetic, and machine learning. Since he was fond of the interplay of these sciences towards the study of the brain after his Ph.D., he received a fully funded postdoctoral position at the Oakland University, Detroit, Michigan from the US in the field of NMR. Then, as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow, he joined CLIC’s Neuroimaging workgroup hosted by the CARES in Jun 2022. This project was a collaboration between Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore and the University of Cambridge, England. Dr. Elias Ebrahimzadeh is currently working in the Neuroimaging Laboratory, School of Cognitive Sciences, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), Tehran, Iran as a postdoctoral research fellow and an Assistant Prof. applying multimodal techniques in the fields of Neuroscience and Neurophysics.

We combine self-paced module learning with tutorials and project-based practical work under Teaching Assistant (TA) advising over two phases during the semester.\nPreparation Phase (Mid-March to early May) Singapore students in the BrainHack School Singapore NTU (BHS-SG-NTU) hub will do self-paced module learning with primary advising by local TAs.\nInternational Phase (May to June) We will join with the BHS international hub. Students submit weekly module tutorials to the local hub courses. In addition, students propose, work on, and submit progress reports on their own practical projects, working collaboratively with students and TAs from local or other hubs. The final week will be a mini-symposium for students to share their research findings. There will also be talks by faculty and other professionals as schedule permits.\nTeaching platforms We will use Discord as the main communication platform for posting announcements, raising questions, sharing resources, networking, and comments on tutorials and projects. For Taiwan, we will primarily use the BrainHack.School.Singapore, Discord server before and after the Brainhack school. During the International Phase, we will shift primary engagement to the international Discord server (link provided later in course) to foster collaborative work.\nCourse Requirement Personal computer with installed softwares as needed for your own project. You will also need Discord, and a Github account to submit your project final product as a Github repository. See Technical help. Backgrounds in cognitive neuroscience and coding are optional but very strongly recommended. A strong motivational capacity for self-learning, question-generation, and problem-solving for your own project.

As technology and globalisation are changing the nature of labour markets and increasing the demand for high levels of skill, the need for individuals to be able to develop new skills during their working careers is becoming increasingly pressing. While there is an increased recognition of the need for flexible behavioural and transferable skills, there is currently a gap in evidence-based training programmes that can effectively support and promote cognitive flexibility across the life course.\nThe Centre for Lifelong Learning and Individualised Cognition (CLIC) programme aims to address this gap by developing innovative research in the science of learning and translating it to educational and real-life applications across the life course. We will adopt an integrated interdisciplinary approach that marries cross-disciplinary expertise and methodologies across Cambridge and NTU to target three life periods (early years, adolescence, middle age) when flexible behaviour is critical for coping with highly changing circumstances. Working together, we aspire to provide Singapore with a competitive leading edge in the Science of Learning through its transformative theory, methodological innovation, and high-impact practical outcomes.\nOngoing Project:\nUnderstanding and promoting individual cognitive flexibility – funded by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister’s Office Singapore under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme.

However, the influence of reward and competition during social learning is less understood. The literature suggests that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is implicated in hot executive functioning (EF), while the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is related to cool EF. In addition, reward processing deficits are associated with atypical connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and the dorsofrontal regions. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine the role of hot and cool EF in reward processing and their relationship to performance under social competition. We adapted a reward-based n-back task to examine the neural correlates of hot and cool EF and the reward influence on performance during competition. A total of 29 healthy adults showed cortical activation associated with individual differences in EF abilities during fMRI scans. Hot and cool EF activated distinct networks in the right insula, hippocampus, left caudate nucleus, and superior parietal gyrus during the no-competition task, while they differentially activated the right precuneus and caudate nucleus in the competition condition. Further analysis revealed correlations between the Hot–Cool network and reward sensitivity and risk-taking behaviour. The findings provided further insights into the neural basis of hot and cool EF engagement in the socio-emotional regulation for learning.","tags":["fMRI","social competition","reward sensitivity"],"title":"A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Investigation of Hot and Cool Executive Functions in Reward and Competition.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Register here to join us on 14th December 2024!\n","date":1734184800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1734184800,"objectID":"7363b9bcd8a636e2a59c2cead3229c03","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/talk/2024_brainnorm_outreach/","publishdate":"2024-12-14T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2024_brainnorm_outreach/","section":"talk","summary":"Register here to join us on 14th December 2024!","tags":["learning"],"title":"Exploring Children's Reading with Brain-NORM","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Sagarika Bhattacharjee","Rajan Kashyap","Vanteemar S.

One important decision for the clinician is the selection of an appropriate montage—conventional or high-definition (HD)—to implement dose-controlled tDCS while maintaining the patient’s safety.\nMethods:\nThe present study simulated tDCS administration using T1-weighted brain images of 50 dementia, 25 depression patients, and 25 healthy individuals for two conventional and HD montages, targeting the regions of interest (ROIs) in the dorsal and ventral pathways that support language processing. For each tDCS configuration, the electric fields at the ROIs and the individualized dose required to achieve the desired current intensity at the target ROI across the subjects were estimated. Linear regression was performed on these parameters.\nResults:\nA significant relationship between atrophy and current dose that varies according to the disease was found. The dementia patients with significant brain atrophy required a higher personalized dosage for HD montage, as the current intensity at the target ROIs was lower and more variable than that of conventional montage. For dementia, tDCS individualization is pathway-dependent, wherein HD configuration of the dorsal route requires current dosages above the safety limit (\u003e4 mA) for 46% of individuals. However, there was no significant difference in electrode configurations between the HD and traditional setups for depression and healthy volunteers without significant brain atrophy.\nConclusions:\nHD-tDCS with fixed locations is limited, making conventional tDCS more effective for dose-controlled applications. In patients with atrophy, individualized adjustments based on simulations are needed due to the variable stimulation strength in the ROI.\n","tags":["tDCS","precision medicine"],"title":"Personalized Dose Selection for Treatment of Patients with Neuropsychiatric Disorders Using tDCS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","ZenJuen-Lau","Tam-Pham","anshu-te","Stephanie Kirk","Claudia Liauw","Annabel Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1731456000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1731456000,"objectID":"8e5c84009e0fdf6062f8a54362f8533c","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2024_deception-tom/","publishdate":"2024-11-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024_deception-tom/","section":"publication","summary":"While a large part of the deception literature focuses on lying detection, the factors contributing to one’s ability to lie remain unclear. The present study examined the contribution of Theory of Mind (ToM) and interoception on our ability to lie using a directed lie paradigm with two conditions (“Interrogation” and “Polygraph”), designed to enhance each of the two mechanisms. Given the relatively small sample size (n = 26 × 40 trials), special steps were taken to avoid false positives. Our results suggest that various facets of interoceptive abilities are positively related to the self-rated confidence in one’s own lies, especially when under the belief that bodily signals are being monitored (i.e., in the “Polygraph” condition). Beyond providing evidence for the role of the body in lying and raising interesting questions for deception science, these results carry practical implications for criminology and lie detection protocols.","tags":["Deception","Theory of Mind"],"title":"The Heart Can Lie: A Preliminary Investigation of the Role of Interoception and Theory of Mind in Deception","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Now Open for Applications\nThe Clinical Brain Lab within the School of Social Sciences is looking to hire several part-time undergraduate research assistants.

A prevailing explanation for these mixed results lies in the ignorance of the complex, multidimensional nature of bilingualism across previous studies. To address this issue, the present study examines bilingual effects from a holistic perspective, accounting for multiple levels of linguistic and non-linguistic factors including individual, interpersonal, social, and ecological. 148 undergraduate Mandarin-English bilinguals were asked to complete the Flanker task and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test to measure conflict monitoring, inhibition, and mental set shifting. Linguistic and non-linguistic characteristics were assessed through questionnaires and interview. Results of stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that years of English use predicted conflict monitoring, English proficiency predicted conflict monitoring and inhibition, and English-speaking time in class predicted mental set shifting. These results support that factors at multiple levels impact differently on separate dimensions of cognitive control, highlighting a need to better measure and account for linguistic and non-linguistic variability in bilingual samples.","tags":["Learning"],"title":"Bilingualism from a holistic perspective: investigation of bilingual effects on cognitive control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vae Zhang Jiayi","Wilson Lim","Annabel Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1728432000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1728432000,"objectID":"869606bba0e741226dc6de2abc4f9dd9","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2024_bayesian-inference-neural/","publishdate":"2024-09-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024_bayesian-inference-neural/","section":"publication","summary":"Hierarchical relations drive state changes in environments.

DMN regions correlated with low-frequency stimuli in theta-alpha bands, suggesting context processing. FMRI data shows that younger adults had higher activity in the salience network (SN) during estimation of context update and its errors. They had higher activity in parts of DMN and subcortical regions during context update errors, and in precuneus during volatility updates. Overall, older adults exhibited lower brain response but higher behavioral estimates for HBI compared to younger adults. Differing patterns of HBI observed across behavior, neural oscillations, and network activity, suggest that as we age, reliance on familiarity increases, and skills required for uncertainty estimation decline, reflected as changes in neural dynamics, where overall functional network connectivity becomes less efficient and granular.","tags":["Bayesian inference","Ageing","EEG","fMRI"],"title":"Differential neural activity across Hierarchical Bayesian inference under uncertainty in Older and Younger adults","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adam John Privitera","Rui Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"url_slides: \u0026quot;\u0026quot; url_source: \u0026quot;\u0026quot; url_video: \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ","date":1728432000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1728432000,"objectID":"f560d51b1dbf421dacb4846a6ac3865e","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2024_the-p3-and-academic-performance/","publishdate":"2024-10-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024_the-p3-and-academic-performance/","section":"publication","summary":"Globally, students demonstrate considerable heterogeneity in academic performance even under similar conditions.

A fundamental mechanism underlying Bayesian inference is the notion of prediction. This framework could explain how predictions pertaining to musical (melodic, rhythmic, harmonic) structures engender action, emotion, and learning, expanding related concepts of music research, such as musical expectancies, groove, pleasure, and tension. Moreover, a Bayesian perspective of music perception may shed new insights on the beneficial effects of music in aging. Aging could be framed as an optimization process of Bayesian inference. As predictive inferences refine over time, the reliance on consolidated priors increases, while the updating of prior models through Bayesian inference attenuates. This may affect the ability of older adults to estimate uncertainties in their environment, limiting their cognitive and behavioral repertoire. With Bayesian inference as an overarching framework, this review synthesizes the literature on predictive inferences in music and aging, and details how music could be a promising tool in preventive and rehabilitative interventions for older adults through the lens of Bayesian inference.","tags":["Ageing","Music","Bayesian Inference"],"title":"Understanding Music and Aging through the lens of Bayesian Inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vae Zhang Jiayi","Wilson Lim","Annabel Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1719360000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719360000,"objectID":"580078d26e46fc91ad928793807ae662","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2024_bayesian-inference-aging/","publishdate":"2024-06-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024_bayesian-inference-aging/","section":"publication","summary":"Hierarchical causal relations underlie state changes in dynamic environments.

Homeostatic plasticity in neuronal circuits is crucial for critical learning and depends upon coordinated modulation of synaptic excitation and inhibition through Glutamate and GABA interactions. Disruption in this coordinated neurotransmitter's interplay triggers cognitive deficits, while adaptive modulation contributes to relearning capacity. Studies reported associative interaction with learning and cognitive skills development with neurotransmitters, but the underlying neuro-cognitive model of these interactions is illusive. Using controlled SL training intervention, we aim to investigate the effect of learning in both the neuronal and behavioral levels to assess its transferability to other cognitive abilities.\nMethods:\n113 healthy volunteers aged between 18-55 years were pseudo-randomized to control and training groups matching with age, gender and intelligence. T-group underwent 2-week SL training. Out of the 113, 106 participants completed with post-session magnetic resonance imaging, of which 7 withdrew or dropped out of the study. All MR scans were performed in 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma MRI scanner with a 64-channel head coil. All participants consented to Cognitive testing and MRI sessions with ethics approval from NTU-IRB. MR spectroscopy for GABA quantitation in bilateral left- and right-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were performed at two different time points of pre- and post- SL training sessions along with cognitiveassessments. Each MR session included 3D T1-MPRAGE and 1H-MEGA-PRESS MRS with one unsuppressed water spectra of Navg is 4. Voxels were placed close to middle frontal gyrus maximizing gray matter. Manual shimming resulted linewidth less than 16 Hz. MRS data in BIDS structure was applied for pre-processing and Osprey was used for quantitation of GABA (GABA and macromolecule) and Glx (Glutamate and glutamine). Quality check for MRS data included visual artefacts, head movements, broad Creatine (Cr) linewidth in the OFF-spectra, and poor fitting.\nResults:\nTissue corrected GABA and Glx levels in both left and right DLPFC of study groups did not differ at pre-training stage. After training, the T-group showed significant reduction in R-DLPFC Glx compared to C-group. Paired comparison between sessions showed significant decrease in post-training R-DLPFC GABA in T-group but not in C-group. No significant difference was observed for L-DLPFC GABA, Glx and GABA-Glx ratio across groups and sessions. MRS measures did not relate to SL test-scores. However, R-DLPFC Glx in the T-group correlated positively with switch-cost reaction time between shift-repeat trials of color-shape task, indicating reduced Glx levels in the R-DLPFC relates to short reaction time in the T-group. GABA-Glx ratio in T-group showed significant positive relation with probability shift measure levels in contrast to negative relation observed in C-group. A strategy shifting ability in the T-group is observed in CF, and other cognitive domains (i.e. working memory, inhibition, and non-verbal intelligence) in contrast to C-group.\n","tags":["CLIC","Learning","GABA","Cognition"],"title":"Neurochemical Alterations in Bilateral DLPFC after Structure Learning Training in Healthy Adults","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liz Y Lee","Máiréad P Healy","Nastassja L Fischer","Ke Tong","Annabel Chen","Barbara Sahakian","Zoe Kourtzi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1718323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718323200,"objectID":"9642afc3baa312ce01f507cd1e5d4408","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2024_cognitive-flexibility-training/","publishdate":"2024-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024_cognitive-flexibility-training/","section":"publication","summary":"Interacting with complex and dynamic environments challenges the brain’s ability to adapt to change.

Depression and anxiety are found to correlate with lower heart rate variability (HRV), suggesting reduced respiratory rate variability (RRV) due to linked heartbeat-respiration dynamics. However, few studies have explored HRV in non-clinical samples of young and old adults with reported depression and anxiety symptoms, and none have examined their relationship with RRV. We predict that across both young and old subjects, there will be decreased HRV and RRV indices in individuals with higher depression and anxiety scores. Participants were administered the GAD-7 and PHQ-9, while respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), respiration rate, and indices of HRV and RRV were extracted from collected ECG data. Significant relationships were found in young subjects, with depression scores negatively associated with HF-HRV, in line with results found in clinical populations. Novel findings suggest lowered RRV in young subjects with higher levels of anxiety, indicating reduced flexibility and short-term ANS dysregulation, which is consistent with previous studies examining other indices of respiratory variability and anxiety. Our results suggest that in young subjects with affective symptoms, a decrease in parasympathetic activity is a typical physiological response. However, given effects reduced parasympathetic activity has on resultant physiological responses, findings could suggest that reductions in HRV could be a risk marker for depression.","tags":["Heart Rate Variability","Depression and Anxiety","Ageing"],"title":"Autonomic and respiratory changes in young and old adults with non-clinical depression and anxiety","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhong Miao","Him Cheung","Annabel Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1717632000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1717632000,"objectID":"aa6fd97da30d26b3298b544f15384c42","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2024_fiction-reading-tom/","publishdate":"2024-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024_fiction-reading-tom/","section":"publication","summary":"The understanding of false belief, others’ beliefs can differ from reality, is essential in Theory of Mind, which has been shown to correlate with reading experiences, especially reading literary fiction, yet little research has investigated the neural basis of this relationship.

These tools, including generative AI (ChatGPT) and natural language processing (NLP) models, could also inform practitioners working with clinical populations in the assessment and treatment of aphasia using AI-based interventions such as personalized therapy and adaptive platforms. Although these possibilities have generated enthusiasm in aphasiology, a rigorous interrogation of their limitations is necessary before AI is integrated into practice. We explain the history and first principles of reciprocity between AI and aphasiology, highlighting how lesioning neural networks opened the black box of cognitive neurolinguistic processing. We then argue that when more data from aphasia across languages become digitized and available online, deep learning will reveal hitherto unreported patterns of language processing of theoretical interest for aphasiologists. We also anticipate some problems using AI, including language biases, cultural, ethical, and scientific limitations, a misrepresentation of marginalized languages, and a lack of rigorous validation of tools.

This study will be a critical first step in understanding how deceitful information becomes endorsed by individuals susceptible to fake news beliefs and conspiracy theories, consequently facilitating counteract measures in the future.\nThe first aim of this study is to establish and validate a strong experimental paradigm for investigating the neurocognitive processes underlying the belief in deceptive (i.e., Fake/Real) information. It should be noted that real and fake in this study is defined by the factual accuracy of the information based on current credible news. The second aim is to investigate how these processes can be experimentally modulated and the extent of their impact on one\u0026rsquo;s deception appraisal. This paradigm will then help to build a computational model of reality belief which in turn will be used to predict the effect of specific interventions.\nAlumni:\nResearch Fellows:\nZhong Miao, PhD Research Associate:\nWilson Lim ","date":1706745600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706745600,"objectID":"2ec1c5d6607dc484343fda67d2d4ee80","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/project/fake-news/","publishdate":"2024-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fake-news/","section":"project","summary":"Investigating the neurocognitive processes underlying the belief in fake/real information.","tags":["Social Neuroscience","Deception"],"title":"Perception of Real vs. Fake Information","type":"project"},{"authors":["Adam John Privitera"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1701648000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701648000,"objectID":"0b52431aa2cc4b3fea05ca2783ef0981","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2023_foreignlanguage-integrity/","publishdate":"2023-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_foreignlanguage-integrity/","section":"publication","summary":"In China, the prevalence of academic dishonesty has attracted considerable negative attention. One explanation for observed differences is found in cultural norms around the acceptability of individual unethical academic behaviors. The establishment of international cooperative universities in China presents a unique challenge for educators and administrators due to cultural differences in practices around academic integrity. This is especially relevant in the context of Sino-American universities due to increased tolerance and decreased training concerning plagiarism in Chinese education relative to the USA. The unique academic experience of bilingual Chinese students enrolled in Sino-American universities presents an opportunity to investigate whether academic experience in English influences attitudes and behaviors around academic integrity. Drawing from research on the foreign language effect, the present study tested the hypothesis that knowledge, and by extension behavior, associated with academic integrity is bound to the English language. Mandarin-English bilingual university students (n = 106) completed both objective and self-report assessments of language experience and responded to two dilemmas designed to mirror commonly experienced academic scenarios presented in either Mandarin or English. We identified a modulatory role of English proficiency with higher levels associated with a lower likelihood of academically dishonest behavior. Additional findings support that separable dimensions of English experience interact to modulate responses to academic dilemmas. Findings suggest that higher levels of English proficiency may reflect higher access to Western norms around academic integrity.","tags":["Learning"],"title":"Is there a foreign language effect on academic integrity?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"\n","date":1696896000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696896000,"objectID":"95fea73f001b177a7f015a2cc0b397cd","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/post/brainnorm/","publishdate":"2023-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/brainnorm/","section":"post","summary":"Recruiting children from 5-7 years old!","tags":["Learning"],"title":"Reading and Math in Young Children","type":"post"},{"authors":["Rui Sun","Andy S.K.

Today, the use of blind source separation (BSS) methods, including independent component analysis (ICA) and second-order blind identification (SOBI), is considered an essential step in improving the quality of neural signals. Recently, we introduced a method consisting of SOBI and a discriminant and similarity (DANS)-based identification method, capable of identifying and extracting eye movement–related components. These recovered components can be localized within ocular structures with a high goodness of fit (\u003e95%). This raised the possibility that such EEG-derived SOBI components may be used to build predictive models for tracking gaze position. As proof of this new concept, we designed an EEG-based virtual eye-tracker (EEG-VET) for tracking eye movement from EEG alone. The EEG-VET is composed of a SOBI algorithm for separating EEG signals into different components, a DANS algorithm for automatically identifying ocular components, and a linear model to transfer ocular components into gaze positions. The prototype of EEG-VET achieved an accuracy of 0.920° and precision of 1.510° of a visual angle in the best participant, whereas an average accuracy of 1.008° ± 0.357° and a precision of 2.348° ± 0.580° of a visual angle across all participants (N = 18). This work offers a novel approach that readily co-registers eye movement and neural signals from a single-EEG recording, thus increasing the ease of studying neural mechanisms underlying natural cognition in the context of free eye movement.","tags":["EEG","Eye-tracking"],"title":"Tracking gaze position from EEG: Exploring the possibility of an EEG-based virtual eye-tracker","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yanjun Wei","Yingjuan Tang","Adam John Privitera"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1694563200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694563200,"objectID":"46b321b01068624e43bcf67b4d442d87","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2023_chinese-syntax-semantics/","publishdate":"2023-09-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_chinese-syntax-semantics/","section":"publication","summary":"Studies on sentence processing in inflectional languages support that syntactic structure building functionally precedes semantic processing.

It enables individuals to swiftly adapt to changes in their environment and has significant implications for learning. The present study focuses on investigating changes in cognitive flexibility following an intervention programme—Structure Learning training.\nMethods:\nParticipants are pseudo-randomised to either the Training or Control group, while matched on age, sex, intelligence and cognitive flexibility performance. In the Training group, participants undergo around 2 weeks of training (at least 13 sessions) on Structure Learning. In the Control group, participants do not have to undergo any training and are never exposed to the Structure Learning task. The effects of Structure Learning training are investigated at both the behavioural and neural level. We measured covariates that can influence an individual’s training performance before the training phase and outcome measures that can potentially show training benefits after the training phase. At the behavioural level, we investigated outcomes in both cognitive and social aspects with a primary focus on executive functions. At the neural level, we employed a multimodality approach and investigated potential changes to functional connectivity patterns, neurometabolite concentration in the frontal brain regions, and brain microstructure and myelination.\nDiscussion:\nWe reported the development of a novel training programme based on Structure Learning that aims to hone a general learning ability to potentially achieve extensive transfer benefits across various cognitive constructs. Potential transfer benefits can be exhibited through better performance in outcome measures between Training and Control participants, and positive associations between training performance and outcomes after the training in Training participants. Moreover, we attempt to substantiate behavioural findings with evidence of neural changes across different imaging modalities by the Structure Learning training.\n","tags":["CLIC","RCTs"],"title":"Potential cognitive and neural benefits of a computerised cognitive training programme based on Structure Learning in healthy adults: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ke Tong","Yuan Ni Chan","Cheng Xiaoqin","Bobby Cheon","Michelle Ellefson","Restria Fauziana","Shengchuang Feng","Nastassja Fischer","Balázs Gulyás","Natalie Hoo","David Hung","...","Annabel Chen","..."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1689811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689811200,"objectID":"62b4a81ed78ffd5535f751d01769de53","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2023_cognitive_flexibility_ef/","publishdate":"2023-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_cognitive_flexibility_ef/","section":"publication","summary":"Background:\nCognitive flexibility (CF) enables individuals to readily shift from one concept or mode of practice/thoughts to another in response to changes in the environment and feedback, making CF vital to optimise success in obtaining goals.

The current study aims to (1) establish the construct validity of CF in relation to other executive function skills and intelligence, and (2) elucidate specific relationships between CF, structure learning, creativity, career decision making and planning, and other life skills.\nMethods:\nThis study will recruit up to 400 healthy Singaporean young adults (age 18–30) to complete a wide range of cognitive tasks and social questionnaires/tasks. The richness of the task/questionnaire battery and within-participant administration enables us to use computational modelling and structural equation modelling to examine connections between the latent constructs of interest.\nSignificance and Impact:\nThe current study is the first systematic investigation into the construct validity of CF and its interrelationship with other important cognitive skills such as learning and creativity, within an Asian context. The study will further explore the concept of CF as a non-unitary construct, a novel theoretical proposition in the field. The inclusion of a structure learning paradigm is intended to inform future development of a novel intervention paradigm to enhance CF. Finally, the results of the study will be useful for informing classroom pedagogy and the design of lifelong learning policies and curricula, as part of the wider remit of the Cambridge-NTU Centre for Lifelong Learning and Individualised Cognition (CLIC).\n","tags":["CLIC","Cognitive Flexibility","executive functions","learning"],"title":"Study protocol: How does cognitive flexibility relate to other executive functions and learning in healthy young adults?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"\n","date":1682553600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696896000,"objectID":"987fd9f2f9eb35a70d66f9fbed01fa2c","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/post/kid-biliteracy/","publishdate":"2023-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/kid-biliteracy/","section":"post","summary":"Looking for P2 and P3 Chinese-English Bilingual Children (8-9 years old)","tags":["biliteracy"],"title":"MRI Space Mission","type":"post"},{"authors":["Makoto Miyakoshi","Josephine Astrid Archer","Chiao-Yi Wu","Toshiharu Nakai","Shen-Hsing Annabel Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1681948800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681948800,"objectID":"04834c42ba604eb27b96bfa5673f26a3","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2023_aging_sensors/","publishdate":"2023-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_aging_sensors/","section":"publication","summary":"The posterior-to-anterior shift in aging (PASA) effect is seen as a compensatory model that enables older adults to meet increased cognitive demands to perform comparably as their young counterparts.

Thus, we aimed to assess cerebellar involvement in reading processes and hypothesised differential activation of the right Lobule VI and right Crus I for lexical reading processes, and the right Lobule VI, right Crus II, and right Lobule VIIB for sub-lexical reading processes. The findings clearly support cerebellar involvement in reading and indicate lateralisation of cerebellar functions in reading, consistent with the right cerebellar hemisphere association  with language-related processes. However, the proposed hypotheses were partially supported as the right Lobule VI and VIIB were implicated in both sub-lexical and lexical processing in reading. Contrary to predictions, the right Crus II was involved in lexical reading processes, which is, nonetheless, consistent with findings of  semantic prediction processes in the region. Findings for Crus I could have been limited due to the relatively less task demands on semantic processing.

Unfortunately, few studies compare the relationship and objective performance of the plethora of existing metrics, in turn hindering reproducibility, replicability, consistency, and clarity in the field. Using the NeuroKit2 Python software, we computed a list of 112 (predominantly used) complexity indices on signals varying in their characteristics (noise, length and frequency spectrum). We then systematically compared the indices by their computational weight, their representativeness of a multidimensional space of latent dimensions, and empirical proximity with other indices. Based on these considerations, we propose that a selection of 12 indices, together representing 85.97% of the total variance of all indices, might offer a parsimonious and complimentary choice in regards to the quantification of the complexity of time series. Our selection includes CWPEn, Line Length (LL), BubbEn, MSWPEn, MFDFA (Max), Hjorth Complexity, SVDEn, MFDFA (Width), MFDFA (Mean), MFDFA (Peak), MFDFA (Fluctuation), AttEn.

This association could be mechanistically explained by the structural and functional connections between the prefrontal cortex, which plays a central role in cognitive control, and the cardiovascular system. In this regard, the role of afferent neural activity from arterial baroreceptors during the two different cardiac phases (diastole and systole) has received great interest. According to the baroreceptor hypothesis, increased ventricular pressure during the systole phase intensifies the afferent signals from the baroreceptor, thereby depleting mental resources and inhibiting cortical activity. While some have indeed found the systole phase exhibiting an inhibiting effect, supporting the aforementioned hypothesis, other studies have observed that participants performed better in tasks of cognitive control when stimuli were presented in the systole phase. As such, this study aimed to clarify the conflicting findings regarding the impact of the cardiac phase on cognitive function. Instead of using the conventional dichotomous method that contrasts only the average performance indices of each phase, we adopt a continuous modeling approach to better capture its non-linear effect on cognitive control.","tags":["Deception"],"title":"A Closer Look at Cardiac Contraction and the Effect of Cardiac Timing on Cognitive Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","ZenJuen-Lau","Tam-Pham","AnShu-Te","Annabel Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1652918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652918400,"objectID":"11f9c7acf9f7141c4e396670d359d31e","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2022_restingstatecomplexity/","publishdate":"2022-05-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_restingstatecomplexity/","section":"publication","summary":"Resting state electroencephalogram (rsEEG) is a non-invasive and inexpensive measure of neural activity, with rest presenting a unique, individual-specific condition (i.e., situation-independent) for tapping into the spontaneous cognitive processes associated with the organized baseline state of the brain.

Specifically, previous studies have shown that the superior and inferior portions of the cerebellum are involved in diferent verbal working memory (WM) mechanisms as part of two separate cerebro-cerebellar loops for articulatory rehearsal and phonological storage mechanisms. In comparison, our understanding of the involvement of the cerebellum in visual WM remains limited. We have previously shown that performance in verbal WM is disrupted by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the right superior cerebellum. The present study aimed to expand on this notion by exploring whether the inferior cerebellum is similarly involved in visual WM. Here, we used fMRI-guided, double-pulse TMS to probe the necessity of left superior and left inferior cerebellum in visual WM. We first conducted an fMRI localizer using the Sternberg visual WM task, which yielded targets in left superior and inferior cerebellum. Subsequently, TMS stimulation of these regions at the end of the encoding phase resulted in decreased accuracy in the visual WM task. Differences in the visual WM deficits caused by stimulation of superior and inferior left cerebellum raise the possibility that these regions are involved in different stages of visual WM.","tags":["Cerebellum"],"title":"Cerebellar Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Impairs Visual Working Memory","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Now Open for Applications\nThe Centre for Research and Development in Learning (CRADLE), led by Principal Investigator Prof. Annabel Chen, is looking to hire several part-time undergraduate research assistants.\nYou will be part of a dynamic team of researchers who apply multi-modal approaches, including neurocognitive assessments, and neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms of literacy and numeracy development in young children.\nJob Scope Depending on the study you are assisting in, you might be involved in some of the following activities:\nAssist with participant recruitment and eligibility screening Assist with behavioural, fNIRS and/or MRI data collection Assist with data coding, maintenance and preprocessing Assist with the translation of research documents Other activities that support the research studies Requirements You must be a current undergraduate student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) A self-directed learner who is eager to learn about advanced neuroimaging research Prior experience or have interests in working with young children Ability to work on some weekends (for data collection) Previous experience in neurocognitive or neuroimaging research is an advantage Ability to help with translations (i.e. Mandarin, Malay or Tamil) is an advantage Apply If you are interested in this job opening, please contact:\nResearch Fellow: Dr. Lynette Looi\nEmail: lynette.looi@ntu.edu.sg\nFlyer ","date":1644534000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696118400,"objectID":"5bd975b5d6c112218e3681be5425a61e","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/join/join_cbl_part-time-ra/","publishdate":"2022-02-11T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/join/join_cbl_part-time-ra/","section":"join","summary":"Now Open for Applications\nThe Centre for Research and Development in Learning (CRADLE), led by Principal Investigator Prof. Annabel Chen, is looking to hire several part-time undergraduate research assistants.\nYou will be part of a dynamic team of researchers who apply multi-modal approaches, including neurocognitive assessments, and neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms of literacy and numeracy development in young children.","tags":null,"title":"Part-time Student Assistant Position at CRADLE","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Victoria Leong","Kausar Raheel","Jia Yi Sim","Kriti Kacker","Vasilis M Karlaftis","Chrysoula Vassiliu","Kastoori Kalaivanan","Annabel Chen","Trevor W Robbins","Barbara J Sahakian","Zoe Kourtzi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1641427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641427200,"objectID":"3ced46a2ec446e6470a1db552cb7bcda","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2022_webbased-cognitive-testing/","publishdate":"2022-01-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_webbased-cognitive-testing/","section":"publication","summary":"Background:\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a fundamental reexamination of how human psychological research can be conducted safely and robustly in a new era of digital working and physical distancing.

Age and sex might affect current density at target ROI due to their impact on cortical anatomy. The present tDCS simulation study investigates the effects of cortical anatomical parameters (volumes, dimension, and torque) on simulated tDCS current density in healthy young, middle-aged, and older males and females. Methodology: Individualized head models from 240 subjects (120 males, 18-87 years of age) were used to identify the estimated current density (2mA current intensity, 25cm2 electrode) from two simulated tDCS montages (CP5_CZ and F3_FP2) targeting the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), respectively. Cortical parameters including segmented brain volumes (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], grey and white matter), cerebral-dimensions (length/ width \u0026length/height) and brain-torque (front and back shift, petalia, and bending) were measured using the magnetic resonance images (MRIs) from each subject. The present study estimated sex differences in current density at these target ROIs mediated by these cortical parameters within each age group. Results: For both tDCS montages, females in the older age group received higher current density than their male counterparts at the target ROIs. No sex differences were observed in the middle-aged group. Males in the younger age group had a higher current density than females, only for the parietal montage. Across all age groups, CSF, and grey matter volumes significantly predicted the current intensity estimated at the target sites. In the older age group only, brain-torque was a significant mediator of the sex difference. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the presence of sex differences in the simulated tDCS current density, however this pattern differed across age groups and stimulation locations. Future studies should consider influence of age and sex on individual cortical anatomy and tailor tDCS stimulation parameters accordingly.","tags":["tDCS"],"title":"Sex difference in tDCS current mediated by changes in cortical anatomy: A study across young, middle and older adults","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2021.\n","date":1634774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634774400,"objectID":"0a3641692b0257a0217ab0d515802784","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/talk/2021_brainconnects/","publishdate":"2021-10-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2021_brainconnects/","section":"talk","summary":"Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2021.","tags":["BrainConnects"],"title":"BrainConnects 2021","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Rajan Kashyap","Sagarika Bhattacharjee1","Ramaswamy Arumugam","Rose Dawn Bharath","Kaviraja Udupa","Kenichi Oishi","John E.

The objective is to stimulate the target region of interest (ROI) while minimizing the current in non-target ROIs (the ‘focality’ of tDCS). For this purpose, determining the appropriate current dose for an individual is difficult. Aim: To introduce a dose–target determination index (DTDI) to quantify the focality of tDCS and examine the dose–focality relationship in three different populations. Method: Here, we extended our previous toolbox i-SATA to the MNI reference space. After a tDCS montage is simulated for a current dose, the i-SATA(MNI) computes the average (over voxels) current density for every region in the brain. DTDI is the ratio of the average current density at the target ROI to the ROI with a maximum value (the peak region). Ideally, target ROI should be the peak region, so DTDI shall range from 0 to 1. The higher the value, the better the dose. We estimated the variation of DTDI within and across individuals using T1-weighted brain images of 45 males and females distributed equally across three age groups: (a) young adults (20 ≤ x \u003c 40 years), (b) mid adults (40 ≤ x \u003c 60 years), and (c) older adults (60 ≤ x \u003c 80 years). DTDI’s were evaluated for the frontal montage with electrodes at F3 and the right supraorbital for three current doses of 1 mA, 2 mA, and 3 mA, with the target ROI at the left middle frontal gyrus. Result: As the dose is incremented, DTDI may show (a) increase, (b) decrease, and (c) no change across the individuals depending on the relationship (nonlinear or linear) between the injected tDCS current and the distribution of current density in the target ROI. The nonlinearity is predominant in older adults with a decrease in focality. The decline is stronger in males. Higher current dose at older age can enhance the focality of stimulation. Conclusion: DTDI provides information on which tDCS current dose will optimize the focality of stimulation. The recommended DTDI dose should be prioritized based on the age (\u003e40 years) and sex (especially for males) of an individual.

Finally, we present important considerations when choosing and interpreting these metrics.","tags":["Deception"],"title":"Brain Entropy, Fractal Dimensions and Predictability: A Review of Complexity Measures for EEG in Healthy and Neuropsychiatric Populations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["ZenJuen-Lau","Dominique Makowski","Tam-Pham","Annabel Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1629936000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629936000,"objectID":"34829604091d0f692ba64b1e23772056","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2021_pyllusion/","publishdate":"2021-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_pyllusion/","section":"publication","summary":"Visual illusions have had considerable importance in the history of psychological science, leading to important scientific breakthroughs in our understanding of perception, consciousness, and the underlying mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or autism. However, despite their historical and theoretical importance as psychological stimuli, there is no dedicated software, nor consistent approach, to generate and report illusions in a systemic fashion. Illusory stimuli are often manually crafted or obtained via pre-made images, making it increasingly difficult for researchers to reproduce visual illusion paradigms and to properly measure the invoked sensitivity. In order to address replicability and reproducibility issues in illusion-based research, we present the Pyllusion package, a Python-based open-source software (freely available at https://github.com/RealityBending/Pyllusion), that implements a parametric framework to manipulate, generate, and report illusions in a systematic way. It is a flexible programming-based tool, as it can be easily incorporated with experimental software (such as PsychoPy) or pre-generated as image files (with the option of different output formats i.e., .png, .jpg, .tiff, etc.). Currently, our parametric approach accommodates several different illusions, especially classical ones such as the Ebbinghaus, Delboeuf, Ponzo, and Müller-Lyer illusions, and the addition of new illusions will be continually integrated as community needs evolve. With Pyllusion, we hope to facilitate a better understanding of critical processes underlying conscious perception and the associated underpinnings of psychopathology.","tags":["Deception"],"title":"A Parametric Framework to Generate Visual Illusions using Python","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tam-Pham","ZenJuen-Lau","Annabel Chen","Dominique Makowski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1623196800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623196800,"objectID":"9dc8ccd17cb915a558b190e6a4ee09d2","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2021_hrv/","publishdate":"2021-06-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_hrv/","section":"publication","summary":"The use of heart rate variability (HRV) in research has been greatly popularized over the past decades due to the ease and affordability of HRV collection, coupled with its clinical relevance and significant relationships with psychophysiological constructs and psychopathological disorders. Despite the wide use of electrocardiograms (ECG) in research and advancements in sensor technology, the analytical approach and steps applied to obtain HRV measures can be seen as complex. Thus, this poses a challenge to users who may not have the adequate background knowledge to obtain the HRV indices reliably. To maximize the impact of HRV-related research and its reproducibility, parallel advances in users’ understanding of the indices and the standardization of analysis pipelines in its utility will be crucial. This paper addresses this gap and aims to provide an overview of the most up-to-date and commonly used HRV indices, as well as common research areas in which these indices have proven to be very useful, particularly in psychology. In addition, we also provide a step-by-step guide on how to perform HRV analysis using an integrative neurophysiological toolkit, NeuroKit2.","tags":["Deception"],"title":"Heart Rate Variability in Psychology: A Review of HRV Indices and an Analysis Tutorial","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","Tam-Pham","ZenJuen-Lau","Adrian Raine","Annabel Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619049600,"objectID":"165fa5dd738b6535e82f167342e299f0","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2020_deception-scale/","publishdate":"2021-04-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_deception-scale/","section":"publication","summary":"While deception is considered as a common phenomenon with important implications, its conceptualization and study as a dispositional trait is under-represented in the literature. Critically, and despite scientific evidence supporting the existence of individual differences in lying, a validated measure of dispositional deception is still lacking. This study aims to explore the structure of dispositional deception by developing and validating a short and reliable 16-item questionnaire to characterize the lying pattern of individuals. Our findings suggest the existence of four distinct latent dimensions to lying, namely frequency, ability, negativity, and contextuality. We establish the convergent validity of our measure of lying by showing significant relationships with social desirability, malevolent traits, cognitive control deficits, normal and pathological personality traits, as well as demographic variables such as sex, age, and religiosity. Overall, the present study introduces a general framework to understanding deception as a dispositional trait which future deception studies can build on, accounting for the inter-individual variability in lying.","tags":["Deception","Social Neuroscience"],"title":"The Structure of Deception: Validation of the Lying Profile Questionnaire","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","Tam-Pham","ZenJuen-Lau","Jan C.

Previous studies acknowledge abnormalities within and beyond the fronto-striato-limbic circuit in OCD that require further clarifications. However, limited information could be inferred from the conventional way of investigating the functional connectivity differences between OCD and healthy controls. Here, we identified altered brain organization in patients with OCD by applying individual-based approaches to maximize the identification of underlying network-based features specific to the OCD group. rsfMRI of 20 patients with OCD and 22 controls were preprocessed, and individual-fMRI-subspace was derived for each subject within each group. We evaluated group differences in functional connectivity using individual-fMRI-subspace and established its advantage over conventional-fMRI methodology. We applied prediction-based approaches to highlight the group differences by evaluating the differences in functional connections that predicted the clinical scores (namely, the Obsessive–Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale). Then, we explored the brain network organization of both groups by estimating the subject-specific communities within each group. Lastly, we evaluated associations between the inter-individual variation of nodes in the communities to clinical measures using linear regression. Functional connectivity analysis using individual-fMRI-subspace detected 83 connections that were different between OCD and control groups, compared to none found using conventional-fMRI methodology. Connectome-based prediction analysis did not show significant overlap between the two groups in the functional connections that predicted the clinical scores. This suggests that the functional architecture in patients with OCD may be different compared to controls. Seven communities were found in both groups. Interestingly, within the OCD group but not controls, we observed functional connectivity between cerebellar and visual regions, and lack of connectivity between striato-limbic and frontal areas. Inter-individual variations in the community-size of these two communities were also associated with the OCI-R score (p \u003c .005). Due to our small sample size, we further validated our results by (i) accounting for head motion, (ii) applying global signal regression (GSR) in data processing, and (iii) using an alternate atlas for parcellation. While the main results were consistently observed with accounting for head motion and using another atlas, the key findings were not reproduced with GSR application. The study demonstrated the existence of disconnectedness in fronto-striato-limbic community and connectedness between cerebellar and visual areas in OCD patients, which was also related to the clinical symptomatology of OCD.","tags":["Cerebellum","OCD"],"title":"Individual-fMRI-approaches reveal cerebellum and visual communities to be functionally connected in obsessive compulsive disorder","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hengshuang Liu","Makoto Miyakoshi","Toshiharu Naka","Annabel Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1608508800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608508800,"objectID":"ee1f2cb9f51e856b66e5e90e4c12c67a","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2020_ageing-adutiroy-processing/","publishdate":"2020-12-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_ageing-adutiroy-processing/","section":"publication","summary":"The efficacy of listening comprehension is presumably sustained over the life span, contradicting the stereotype of universal cognitive decline.

Previous research indicates that pathway recruitment in bilinguals depends on a script’s orthographic depth and a reader’s proficiency with it. The effect of tDCS on each reading pathway has not been investigated in bilinguals. We stimulated the left dorsal and ventral pathways separately in Chinese-English (C-E) bilinguals to understand whether pathway-specific modulation by tDCS is possible and, if so, how it is influenced by orthographic depth and script proficiency. Methods: A double-blind, sham-controlled, within-subject experiment was designed wherein 16 balanced bilinguals received anodal tDCS in dorsal, ventral and sham sessions. Two tDCS montages of electrode sizes 5 x 5 cm2 with 1) anode at CP5 and cathode at CZ, and 2) anode at TP7 and cathode at nape of the neck, were applied for stimulating the dorsal and ventral pathways respectively. Bilinguals were asked to read word lists for each language before and after stimulation. RTs for accurate trials were analysed using linear mixed-effect modelling that included proficiency scores for reading English pseudo-words (PW) and Chinese pinyin. Results: For both languages, word reading RTs were faster following dorsal pathway stimulation. The dorsal stimulation effect (change in RT) was negatively correlated with pseudoword reading and pinyin proficiency. Stimulation of the ventral pathway decreased RTs only for Chinese reading. Conclusion: Dorsal and ventral reading pathways can be selectively modulated by tDCS in bilingual readers with dorsal (sub-lexical) pathway stimulation affecting reading in both scripts and ventral (lexical) pathway stimulation selectively affecting Chinese reading. Dorsal pathway tDCS effects are modulated by sub-lexical reading proficiency.","tags":["Learning","Biliteracy","tDCS"],"title":"Reading proficiency influences the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation: Evidence from selective modulation of dorsal and ventral pathways of reading in bilinguals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","ZenJuen-Lau","Tam-Pham","Annabel Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"As the COVID-19 outbreak spreads across the globe, the world is in parallel flooded by information reporting a wide range of facts, which veracity is not always verifiable. Indeed, it has become increasingly apparent that the COVID-19 fake news pandemic is becoming just as viral as the outbreak of the disease itself, evidenced by the need for researchers and authorities to track the spread of misinformation. As a consequence, the Ministry of Health in Singapore has even dedicated an entire website (See here: https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/clarifications) to debunk all instances of fake news.\nThe Role of Conspiracy Theories While the authorities are struggling to provide concrete explanations about the coronavirus, conspiracy theorists are quick to provide competing ones with confidence. This has exaggerated the spread of fake news and conspiracy theories - beliefs that seek to explain the cause of an event by a hidden, wicked and unlawful scheme, without scientific support. For instance, a theory that the new 5G technology causes the spread of coronavirus outbreak was widely circulated and peddled by conspiracy theorists. Studies have shown that conspiracy theories are often endorsed by people who feel powerless. Their rejection of mainstream accounts and adoption of conspiracy explanations is an attempt to make sense of the world beyond their control (Swami \u0026amp; Furnham, 2010). The uncertainties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic might prompt people, especially individuals with higher schizotypal tendencies (characterized by suspicion, social anxiety and paranoid ideation), to engage in this sense-making mechanism, seeking alternative explanations to regain their sense of control. People who have the tendency to adopt conspiracy theories have been found to rely more on intuition (Pennycook, Cheyne, Barr, Koehler \u0026amp; Fugelsang, 2015; Pennycook \u0026amp; Rand, 2018) and are hence more susceptible to fake news beliefs.\nThe Role of Emotions In a global pandemic where the world is in a constant elevated state of anxiety, fake news beliefs can befall anyone for reasons beyond just the persistent cognitive biases that characterize conspiracist theorists. People are often left feeling fearful and anxious due to the endless bombardment of pandemic news information, regardless of its accuracy. Fake news on COVID-19 are especially emotionally engaging because they play on people’s helplessness by offering some miracle remedy or fueling anger towards authorities handling the situation.\nA research team led by Gordon Pennycook, a researcher on the psychology of misinformation, found that individuals are more likely to perceive fake news headlines as accurate when they were in an emotional state (Martel et al., 2019). At the Clinical Brain Lab, we have started research into this area during the Circuit Breaker period. We propose that the underlying factor driving susceptibility to fake news beliefs is not just the mere presence of negative affect, but how one regulates these emotions. This refers to the ability to control one’s emotional state, such as considering alternative interpretations of an otherwise negative situation.\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, an important aspect of emotion regulation is being able to navigate through the uncertainties of the future. With future plans now at a standstill and emotions running high, we become less tolerant of uncertainty and feel more helpless about our circumstances. Poor self-control makes us cognitively lazy, believing something because “it feels right” and aligned with our emotions. Fast, intuitive processing thus often takes precedence over effortful and reflective thinking, of which the latter is needed to discern whether a piece of news is real or fake (Pennycook \u0026amp; Rand, 2019). We are thus more vulnerable to engaging in fake news than we think.\nOur Research As it is important to delineate the psychological determinants of the belief in fake news as part of a global effort in combating misinformation, Prof Annabel Chen together with Research Fellow Dr Dominique Makowski and research assistants (Pham Thanh Tam and Lau Zen Juen) are currently conducting an investigation into the spread of COVID-19 fake news in Singapore. Specifically, this study seeks to examine whether the belief in conspiracy theories and one’s ability to regulate emotions are related to one’s tendency to fall prey to fake news. This study is pre-registered at OSF and currently undergoing data analysis.\n","date":1600387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600387200,"objectID":"85dc60021238af40d10b624977773cfa","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2020_deception-covid-fakenews/","publishdate":"2020-09-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_deception-covid-fakenews/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study, we seek to examine whether the belief in conspiracy theories and one’s ability to regulate emotions are related to one’s tendency to fall prey to fake news.","tags":["Deception","Social Neuroscience"],"title":"Psychological Determinants of the Susceptibility to Fake News amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alicia Goodwill","Masato Kawabata","Wilson Lim","Vae Zhang Jiayi","Annabel Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"Combining both cognitive and exercise training in an intervention program may be advantageous to enhance cognitive and physical functions.

However, such physiological arousal may merely be reflecting anxiety and fear during a polygraph examination, rather than lying per se.\nAs physiological arousal could not be used to accurately infer lying, researchers are urged to further look into the mental processes related to lying. To date, different neurophysiological signals, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERP) have been studied for possible application to index deception. Past studies have shown evidences that strongly supporting the hypothesis that deception requires the coordination of multiple cognitive processes and thus is more cognitively taxing than truth telling. Despite the positive findings, previous studies were often criticized for not capturing lying as it exists in the real world. Indeed, majority of the experimental paradigms required participants to lie about perceptual stimuli or memorized materials. More importantly, unlike lying in the real world, the lies generated in research labs were often not spontaneous but instructed.\nTo increase the translational value of the research in deception and lie detection, we aim to investigate the neural correlates of lying using paradigms that can elicit lying similar to those in the real world.

The distribution of the electric current induced in the brain due to tDCS is provided by simulation toolbox like Realistic-volumetric-Approach-based-Simulator-for-Transcranial-electric-stimulation (ROAST). However, the procedure to estimate the total current density induced at the target and the intermediary region of the cortex is complex. The Systematic-Approach-for-tDCS-Analysis (SATA) was developed to overcome this problem. However, SATA is limited to standardized headspace only. Here we develop individual-SATA (i-SATA) to extend it to individual head. Method: T1-weighted images of 15 subjects were taken from two Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners of different strengths. Across the subjects, the montages were simulated in ROAST. i-SATA converts the ROAST output to Talairach space. The x, y and z coordinates of the anterior commissure (AC), posterior commissure (PC), and Mid-Sagittal (MS) points are necessary for the conversion. AC and PC are detected using the acpcdetect toolbox. We developed a method to determine the MS in the image and cross-verified its location manually using BrainSight. Result: Determination of points with i-SATA is fast and accurate. The i-SATA provided estimates of the current-density induced across an individual’s cortical lobes and gyri as tested on images from two different scanners. Conclusion: Researchers can use i-SATA for customizing tDCS-montages. With i-SATA it is also easier to compute the inter-individual variation in current-density across the target and intermediary regions of the brain. The software is publicly available.","tags":["Software"],"title":"i-SATA: A MATLAB based toolbox to estimate current density generated by transcranial direct current stimulation in an individual brain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sagarika Bhattacharjee","Rajan Kashyap","Turki Abualait","Annabel Chen","Woo-Kyoung Yoo","Shahid Bashir"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1584662400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584662400,"objectID":"0f424719d95dc9cef755b305b50be8f7","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/publication/2020_m1-review/","publishdate":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_m1-review/","section":"publication","summary":"The neuroscience community has widely acknowledged primary motor cortex as a region important for execution of voluntary motor movements.

If the two pathways are stimulated simultaneously, the function of dorsal pathway (predominantly used for graphophonological conversion) might interfere with the function of the ventral pathway (used for semantics), and vice-versa. To achieve functional specificity in tDCS for investigating the two pathways of reading, it is important to stimulate each pathway per session such that the spread of current across the cortical areas due to the two montages has minimal overlap. The present study intends to achieve this by introducing a systematic approach for tDCS analysis. We employed the COMETS2 software to simulate 10 montage configurations (5 for each pathway) for three electrode sizes: 5x5, 3x3, and 5x7cm2. This diversity in montage configuration is chosen since previous studies found the position and the size of anode and cathode to play an important role. The values of the magnitude of current density (MCD) obtained from the configuration were used to calculate: (i) average MCD in each cortical lobe, (ii) number of overlapping coordinates, and (iii) cortical areas with high MCD. The measures (i) and (iii) ascertained the current spread by each montage within a cortical lobe, and (ii) verified the overlap of the spread of current between a pair of montages. The analyses show that a montage using the electrode size of 5x5cm2 with the anode at CP5 and cathode at CZ, and another with anode at TP7 and cathode at nape of the neck are optimal choices for dorsal and ventral pathways, respectively. To verify, we cross-validated the results with ROAST. This systematic approach was helpful in reducing the ambiguity of montage selection prior to conducting a tDCS study.","tags":["tDCS"],"title":"Simulation analyses of tDcS montages for the investigation of dorsal and ventral pathways","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Description Complex Span is a PsychoPy implementation of a working memory span task, adapted from Gonthier et al.

TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) is a non-invasive and painless tool that modulates neural activity. It works on the principle of Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. In TMS, an electromagnetic coil sends a perpendicular magnetic field into the region of interest on the scalp. This field indirectly influences neuronal activity. TMS has been shown in some cases to induce cortical excitability and in some cases to depress excitability. TMS can be administered in bursts at a rhythmic frequency (repetitive TMS) or as a single pulse. Repetitive TMS has been shown to have a greater and lasting effect. Depending on the question, rapid or slow repetitive TMS can be administered.\nHow is TMS Done? An electromyography (EMG) module is first attached via a wristband and by pasting electrodes onto the participant.\nAfter setting up the parameters, an experimenter positions the magnetic coil above the participant’s scalp, over the region of interest. When activated, a high-current pulse is produced in the TMS coil, inducing a perpendicular magnetic field. As high-current pulses are sent through the coil, the participant may hear clicks.\nWhat is TMS used for? TMS can be used to treat clinical conditions (such as drug-resistant depression) or be used as an experimental technique to understand brain functions.

Sobczak-Edmans and colleagues (2019) examined the structural and functional connectivity of these cerebro-cerebellar networks. Using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography, they reconstructed white matter tracts in: (1) the left inferior frontal gyrus via the pons to the right superior cerebellum, and (2) the left inferior parietal lobule via the pons to the right inferior cerebellum. They also found that greater structural connectivity of the ponto-superior cerebellar tract was correlated with slower response time for verbal working memory.

We found that women who felt more stressed over the last month were faster at performing the memory task, but men did not show this relationship. Stress was also related to co-activation of brain regions, referred to as functional connectivity, in both women and men: higher stress was associated with increased connectivity between some brain regions but decreased connectivity between other brain regions. Our findings support past findings that women tend to use emotionally focused coping strategies (that is trying to regulate our mood) when stressed, but challenges previous reports that men tend to seek reward (such as alcohol) when stressed.

This pattern of brain organization is known as brain lateralization. However, studies have suggested that brain lateralization is less prominent in older adults. In other words, older adults recruit additional resources from the other side of the brain to achieve similar cognitive functions as with young adults. Heng and colleagues (2017) further examined age-related differences in brain lateralization during language and visuospatial processing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the researchers recorded the brain activation of 16 older (60s) and 21 younger (20s) Japanese adults when the participants judged if two characters/sets of lines had similar or different pronunciations/orientations. Compared with young adults, older adults were slower but equally accurate at making the judgments. When judging language pronunciations, older adults showed greater activation and reduced brain lateralization only in the frontal brain area that is crucially involved in language sound processing, and not meaning.  As this frontal brain area is necessary for judging language pronunciations, the additional recruitment of this brain region on the other side of the brain is suggested to help in maintaining performance accuracy. Results therefore highlight the importance of considering the functional specificity of brain regions when studying age-related differences in cognitive processes.","tags":["Ageing","fMRI"],"title":"The role of regional heterogeneity in age-related differences in functional hemispheric asymmetry: an fMRI study","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2017.\n","date":1503360000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1503360000,"objectID":"d6243c7893d53d7577c464150b39066b","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/talk/2017_brainconnects/","publishdate":"2017-08-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2017_brainconnects/","section":"talk","summary":"Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2017.","tags":["BrainConnects"],"title":"BrainConnects 2017","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Shu-Hui Lee","Zachary Walker","James B.

Differentiated instruction has been offered to help teachers accommodate diverse learners, but most instructional strategies are typically directed at compensating for - not remediating - cognitive and academic skill deficits. This differentiated instruction approach is contrasted with the extant learning science and educational neuroscience literature, which suggests early intervention and remediation of skill deficits is the preferred evidence-based practice. To overcome these competing and apparently contradictory positions, we argue children should be provided with systematic brain-based differentiated instruction in inclusive classrooms to prevent skill deficits, with compensatory accommodations provided only as necessary to help children access the general education curriculum. For those who continue to struggle, we argue remedial efforts should occur outside of, and in addition to, inclusive general education instruction, given the empirical evidence supporting both practices. Implications for training and system-level reform will be addressed.","tags":["Science of Learning"],"title":"Reconciling individual differences with collective needs: The juxtaposition of sociopolitical and neuroscience perspectives on remediation and compensation of student skill deficits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

Recent work has shown the influential role of the salience network over the default mode network (DMN) and executive control network (ECN). This study comprehensively investigates age-related changes in intra- and internetwork connectivity and effective connectivity between the DMN, ECN, and salience network across the adult life span. Two hundred ten participants completed a working memory task, an inhibition task, and a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Networks were extracted using independent component analysis; then, regression analyses and t-tests between three age groups, 21-40 (younger), 41-60 (middle), and 61-80 (older), were conducted. Older age was associated with decreased intranetwork connectivity. Functional network connectivity analyses revealed older age was associated with increased internetwork connectivity between the salience network and the ECNs and DMNs. In both cases, the effects were more pronounced in the tasks compared to resting state. Granger causality analyses indicated the salience network was influenced by the DMN and ECN in all age groups during both tasks, but not rest. However, middle adults showed increased influence from the salience network to the right ECN compared to younger adults during the flanker task. Taking everything into account, these findings indicate the role of the salience network changes over the life span, which may have implications for the early detection of pathophysiology in older adults.","tags":["Ageing","fMRI"],"title":"A comprehensive analysis of connectivity and aging over the adult life span","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Monika Sobczak-Edmans","H.

However, the cerebro-cerebellar network for visual working memory is not as well defined. Our previous fMRI study showed superior and inferior cerebellar activations during a block design visual working memory task, but specific cerebellar contributions to cognitive processes in encoding, maintenance and retrieval have not yet been established. The current study examined cerebellar contributions to each of the components of visual working memory and presence of cerebellar hemispheric laterality was investigated. 40 young adults performed a Sternberg visual working memory task during fMRI scanning using a parametric paradigm. The contrast between high and low memory load during each phase was examined. We found that the most prominent activation was observed in vermal lobule VIIIb and bilateral lobule VI during encoding. Using a quantitative laterality index, we found that left-lateralized activation of lobule VIIIa was present in the encoding phase. In the maintenance phase, there was bilateral lobule VI and right-lateralized lobule VIIb activity. Changes in activation in right lobule VIIIa were present during the retrieval phase. The current results provide evidence that superior and inferior cerebellum contributes to visual working memory, with a tendency for left-lateralized activations in the inferior cerebellum during encoding and right-lateralized lobule VIIb activations during maintenance. The results of the study are in agreement with Baddeley’s multi-component working memory model, but also suggest that stored visual representations are additionally supported by maintenance mechanisms that may employ verbal coding.","tags":["Cerebellum","Working Memory","fMRI"],"title":"Temporal dynamics of visual working memory","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2015.\n","date":1438300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438300800,"objectID":"1690d2192fda472c26a847c074fd93c9","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/talk/2015_brainconnects/","publishdate":"2015-07-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2015_brainconnects/","section":"talk","summary":"Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2015.","tags":["BrainConnects"],"title":"BrainConnects 2015","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2014.\n","date":1406851200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1406851200,"objectID":"46351a4d6cd9cd6b53097ebd9c0fad78","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/talk/2014_brainconnects/","publishdate":"2014-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2014_brainconnects/","section":"talk","summary":"Follow this link to the official website of BrainConnects 2014.","tags":["BrainConnects"],"title":"BrainConnects 2014","type":"talk"}]
