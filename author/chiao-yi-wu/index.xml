      <title>Improving Cognition through Dance in Older Filipinos with MCI</title>
      <link>https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/project/indak/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The project aims to provide scientific evidence on a public health intervention that is contextualized in a community setting to reduce dementia risk among older adults with MCI. This is a cluster-randomized, two-arm, single-blind trial of a multicomponent intervention that combines dance called INDAK (Improving Neurocognition through Dance and Kinesthetics), nutrition counseling, and vascular risk management. The intervention group received 12-16 months of dance sessions and vascular management while the control group (CON) received only the vascular management.
The primary outcome is cognitive performance assessed by several behavioral tasks. Secondary outcomes are functional connectivity assessed through brain imaging, and measures of behavioral, functional level, and quality of life. This model can be an ecological, low-cost, and effective program, thereby conducive to widespread implementation in the Philippines as well as in other low-resource settings with similar public health challenges.
This project is a collaboration with St. Luke&amp;rsquo;s Medical Center, Institute for Neurosciences, Quezon City, Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ongoing Project:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding Brain Networks of Reading and Math</title>
      <link>https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/project/brain-norm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tapping on the advancements of neuroimaging, the project aims to develop a combination of behavioural measures that may be as sensitive as neuroimaging measures to delineate the different learning disabilities subgroups in young children. There is a growing prevalence of learning disabilities (LD) in Reading Difficulties (RD), Math Difficulties (MD) and their comorbidity (Reading-Math Difficulties; RMD) in young children. Given the important roles math and reading play in the development of emerging skills during early school years, early identification is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using advanced neuroimaging methods, we aim to better understand the extent to which reading, math and working memory are subserved by common neural substrates at the individual level. We will then further examine these networks in combination with learning disabilities screeners, which will help to distinguish children with RD, MD and RMD at the neural level. We aim to then identify existing sensitive screening tools to delineate the LD subgroups, which will allow prediction to intervention responsiveness, and enable better tailoring of the intervention these young children will receive from the onset.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bilingual Reading Networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our projects aim to elucidate the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying typical and impaired reading in bilinguals.
We use a combination of behavioural assessment and neuroimaging techniques to investigate the neural reading networks for bilingual readers from a variety of language profiles, across early childhood and adulthood.
Our projects will shed light on the impact of critical factors (e.g., orthographic depth of scripts, auditory perception skills) on the bilingual reading networks. Our findings will provide implications for neuroscience-informed remediation of reading difficulties for bilingual readers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The project aims to develop an early screening and training programme to promote balanced bilingual development and biliteracy attainment in early childhood.
Using a multimodal approach, we will identify early neural, cognitive, and environmental predictors in preschool years for later bilingual and biliteracy development.
We will evaluate the neurocognitive effects of different training programmes on enhancing biliteracy development. The knowledge gained from the project will broaden our understanding of the neurocognitive development of language and reading networks in young bilinguals.
The findings will have significant implications for early screening and effective training for promoting balanced bilingual and biliteracy development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ongoing Project:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
